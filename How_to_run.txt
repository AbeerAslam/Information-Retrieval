This assignment was programmed in Python on PyCharm IDE.
I tried to automate it as much as I can.
You only need to upload the folder "pythonProject1" on the PyCharm.

You only need to run the main.py file after which:
1) The dependencies will be installed automatically.
2) Preprocessing and its folders will be made themselves.
3) Indexes and its folders will be made themselves.
4) After some time the GUI will pop up.
