class decomposit use k mean and hierarch cluster class decomposit , classif , cluster , machin learn thi paper present cluster base class decomposit approach improv perform of classifi . class decomposit work by divid each class into cluster , and by relabel instanc contain by each cluster with new class . sever case studi use class decomposit combin with linear classifi . while there is an essenti improv classif accuraci becaus of class decomposit , most effect cluster algorithm is not obviou . aim of thi work is investig effect of two cluster algorithm , k mean and hierarch , class decomposit . thi work , studi class decomposit when combin with naiv bay classifi use four real world dataset . experiment result show an improv classif accuraci most of dataset when class decomposit use both k mean and hierarch cluster is perform . result also show that class decomposit is not suitabl dataset .
