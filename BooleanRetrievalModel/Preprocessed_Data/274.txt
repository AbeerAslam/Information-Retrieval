consensu cluster : resampl base method build radiat hybrid map radiat hybrid map , cluster , resampl build radiat hybrid ( rh ) map is challeng process . tradit rh map techniqu veri time consum , and not work well noisi dataset . thi present research , propos new approach that use resampl techniqu with consensu cluster techniqu filter out unreli marker , and build robust rh map short time . main aim of use propos approach is : first reduc map comput complex , thu speed map process . and second , filter out unreli marker , and map remain reliabl marker build robust map . propos approach map rh dataset four step , follow : ( 1 ) use jackknif resampl techniqu resampl rh dataset , and group resampl dataset into cluster . ( 2 ) build consensu cluster and filter out unreli marker . ( 3 ) map consensu cluster . ( 4 ) connect consensu cluster ' map form final map . demonstr perform of our propos approach , compar accuraci of construct map with correspond physic map . also , compar run time of our construct map with carthagen tool map run time . result show that propos approach construct robust map compar veri short time .
