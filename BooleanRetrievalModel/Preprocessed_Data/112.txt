evalu real time anomali detect algorithm numenta anomali benchmark anomali detect , time seri data , benchmark , stream data much of world 's data is stream , time seri data , where anomali give signific inform critic situat , exampl abound domain such financ , it , secur , medic , and energi . yet detect anomali stream data is difficult task , requir detector process data real time , not batch , and learn while simultan make predict . there benchmark adequ test and score efficaci of real time anomali detector . here propos numenta anomali benchmark ( nab ) , which attempt provid control and repeat environ of open sourc tool test and measur anomali detect algorithm stream data . perfect detector would detect anomali soon possibl , trigger fals alarm , work with real world time seri data across varieti of domain , and automat adapt chang statist . reward these characterist is formal nab , use score algorithm design stream data . nab evalu detector benchmark dataset with label , real world time seri data . present these compon , and give result and analys sever open sourc , commerci use algorithm . goal nab is provid standard , open sourc framework with which research commun compar and evalu differ algorithm detect anomali stream data .
