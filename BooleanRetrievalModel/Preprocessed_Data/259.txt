bag of bag : nest multi instanc classif prostat cancer detect multi instanc classif , cancer detect , comput aid detect ( cad ) comput aid detect ( cad ) algorithm been propos auto detect of differ type of cancer . cad algorithm reli machin learn method classifi region of interest imag into cancer and healthi region . cancer screen , foremost problem solv is whether patient cancer , regardless of locat of cancer region organ . thi allow earli detect of diseas lead right cours of action term of treatment taken . machin learn , thi problem been formul multi instanc learn ( mil ) where bag of instanc classifi rather than individu instanc . thi paper , propos bag of bag ( bob ) nest mil algorithm where high level bag ( or parent bag ) , each contain multipl smaller bag of instanc . appli propos bob mil algorithm prostat cancer detect problem use magnet reson imag data first detect which patient cancer and consequ , detect which slice 3d volum imag data of detect patient contain cancer region . experiment result obtain from imag data of 30 patient with ground truth data base biopsi result show that propos algorithm is not onli capabl of detect prostat cancer patient level , it is also abl detect cancer region slice level of imag data with high accuraci .
