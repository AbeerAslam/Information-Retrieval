adapt modular approach onlin fault diagnosi of discret event system adapt approach , fault diagnosi , discret event system , diagnosabiliy thi paper , an adapt modular approach is propos achiev fault diagnosi of discret event system . desir ( normal ) behavior is repres by set of specif while fault of each predefin fault type consid execut of specif fault behavior violat specif . infer of fault type of each fault is achiev by diagnosi modul call diagnos . thi approach consid that onli normal behavior is known advanc . then , it adapt diagnos order integr new specif fault behavior into it infer engin . thi adapt allow increas diagnosi capac , call diagnos , over time .
