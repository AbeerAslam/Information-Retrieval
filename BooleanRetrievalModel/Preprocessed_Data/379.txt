uoi nmf cluster : robust nonneg matrix factor algorithm improv part base decomposit and reconstruct of noisi data nonneg matrix factor , interpret machin learn , union of intersect , part base decomposit , neurosci with ever grow collect of larg volum of scientif data , develop of interpret machin learn tool analyz such data is becom more import . howev , robust , interpret machin learn tool lack , threaten extract of scientif insight and discoveri . nonneg matrix factor ( nmf ) algorithm decompos an m n nonneg data matrix into k n basi matrix h and an m k weight matrix w , such that ? wh , where k is desir rank . thi paper , present novel two stage algorithm , uoi nmf cluster nmf , which is base three innov : ( i ) complet separ base learn from weight estim , ( ii ) learn base by cluster nmf result across bootstrap resampl of data , and ( iii ) use recent introduc union of intersect ( uoi ) framework estim ultra spars weight that maxim data reconstruct accuraci . deploy our algorithm variou synthet and scientif data illustr it perform , with focu neurosci data . compar other nmf algorithm , uoi nmf cluster yield : ) more accur part base decomposit of noisi data , b ) spars and accur weight matrix , and c ) high accuraci reconstruct of de nois data . togeth , these improv enhanc perform and interpret of nmf applic noisi data , and suggest similar approach may benefit other matrix decomposit algorithm .
