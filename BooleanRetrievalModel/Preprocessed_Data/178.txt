adapt openmp task schedul use runtim api and machin learn adapt schedul , machin learn , ompt , collector api , openmp task , similar analysi task base program model adopt differ schedul strategi exploit parallel irregular applic . these schedul strategi differ term of exploit data local , maintain load balanc , and minim overhead . openmp task allow programm express unstructur parallel high level of abstract and make runtim respons about burden of schedul parallel execut . irregular applic , perform of task schedul not often predict due natur of applic , use compil , and platform architectur depend . thi work , introduc an automat , portabl , and adapt runtim feedback driven framework ( aparf ) that combin standard low level task runtim api , develop profil tool , and hybrid machin learn model . employ aparf select optimum task schedul scheme of ani given applic use similar analysi through correl between captur runtim api with low profil cost . our hybrid model predict best schedul strategi varieti of unseen applic with an averag accuraci of 93 % , while maintain 100 % train accuraci . an averag perform enhanc of 25 % wa obtain compar with default configur , when aparf wa appli differ unseen program . aparf wa examin against real applic ( molecular dynam ) , where achiev 31 % perform improv . compar intel , pgi and gnu compil , our predict scheme achiev better perform most case .
