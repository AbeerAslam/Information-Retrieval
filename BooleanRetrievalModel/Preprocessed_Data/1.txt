ensembl statist and heurist model unsupervis word align statist word align , ensembl learn , heurist word align statist word align model need larg amount of train data while they weak small size corpora . thi paper propos new approach of unsupervis hybrid word align techniqu use ensembl learn method . thi algorithm use three base align model sever round gener align . ensembl algorithm use weigh scheme resampl train data and vote score consid aggreg align . underli align algorithm use thi studi includ ibm model 1 , 2 and heurist method base dice measur . our experiment result show that by thi approach , align error rate could improv by least % 15 base align model .
