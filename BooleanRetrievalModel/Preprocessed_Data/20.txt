combin exact and metaheurist techniqu learn extend finit state machin from test scenario and tempor properti finit state machin , constraint satisfact problem , ant coloni optim , model check , control , hybrid algorithm thi paper address problem of learn extend finit state machin ( efsm ) from user specifi behavior exampl ( test scenario ) and tempor properti . show how combin exact efsm infer algorithms~ ( that alway find solut if it exist ) and metaheurist deriv an effici combin efsm learn algorithm . also present new exact efsm infer algorithm base constraint satisfact problem ( csp ) solver . experiment result report show that new combin algorithm significantli outperform previous use metaheurist .
