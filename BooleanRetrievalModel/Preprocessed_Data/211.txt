effici and rotat invari fingerprint match algorithm use adjust factor minutia , bifurc , ridg , afi , fingerprint , minutia code thi paper present new effici and rotat invari algorithm that make use of local featur forfingerprint match . minutia point first extract from afingerprint imag . minutia code mc , defin thi paper , is then gener each extract minutia point . propos minutia code is invari rotat of fingerprint imag . adjust factor ( af ) is introduc address problem due differ claimant fingerprint and templat fingerprint of same person that may present due variat ink or variat pressur appli between finger and scanner . adjust factor is calcul from minutia code ( mc ) of two fingerprint be match . two stage fingerprint match process is propos . dure first stage onli few minutia code check decid if second stage of match process is requir . thi make match process faster . propos strategi is test number of publicli avail imag ( db1 of fvc2004 databas ) and result promis .
