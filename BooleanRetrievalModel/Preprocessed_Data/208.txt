sourc awar partit robust cross valid machin learn , cross valid , sourc awar , robust learn one of most critic compon of engin machin learn algorithm live applic is robust perform assess prior it implement . cross valid is use forecast specif algorithm 's classif or predict accuraci new input data given finit dataset train and test algorithm . two most well known cross valid techniqu , random subsampl ( rss ) and k fold , use gener assess result of machin learn algorithm non exhaust random manner . thi work first show that an inertia base activ recognit problem where data is collect from differ user of wrist worn wireless acceleromet , random partit of data , regardless of cross valid techniqu , result statist similar averag accuraci standard feed forward neural network classifi . propos novel sourc awar partit techniqu where sampl from specif user complet left out of train valid set rotat . averag error propos cross valid method is significantli higher with lower standard variat , which is major indic of cross valid robust . approxim 30 % increas averag error rate impli that sourc awar cross valid could better indic of live algorithm perform where test data statist would significantli differ than train data due sourc ( or user ) sensit natur of process data .
