deep learn of cell classif use microscop imag of intracellular microtubul network deep learn , imag classif , cell imag , microtubul , cytoskeleton , radial microtubul network ( mt ) compon of cell that may indic presenc of variou chemic compound and use recogn properti such treatment resist . therefor , classif of mt imag is of great relev cell diagnost . human expert find it particularli difficult recogn level of chemic compound exposur of cell . improv accuraci with autom techniqu would signific impact cell therapi . thi paper present applic of deep learn mt imag classif and evalu it larg mt imag dataset of anim cell with three degre of exposur chemic agent . result demonstr that learn deep network perform par or better correspond cell classif task than human expert . specif , show that task of recogn differ level of chemic agent exposur handl significantli better by neural network than by human expert .
