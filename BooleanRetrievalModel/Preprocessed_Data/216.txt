identifi daili electr consumpt pattern from smart meter data by mean of cluster algorithm fault diagnosi , valv , mathemat model , sensor , radio frequenc , discret event system , adapt model thi paper present cluster approach appli daili energi consumpt curv of build . our aim is identifi reduc set of consumpt pattern tertiari build dure one year . these pattern depend temperatur throughout year well type of day ( work day , work free day and school holiday ) . two cluster approach use independ , name function k mean algorithm , that take into account function aspect of data and expect maxim algorithm base gaussian mixtur model ( em gmm ) . cluster result of two algorithm analyz and compar . thi studi repres first step toward develop of predict model energi consumpt .
