transient characterist of dc dc convert with pid paramet select and neural network control neural network , dc dc convert , pid control thi paper present neural network base pid paramet select control improv transient respons of dc dc convert . convent pid control , paramet of it such proport , integr , and differenti coeffici select fix paramet regul both transient and steadi state characterist simultan much possibl . paramet set of pid control is not optim improv of transient state characterist sinc set need satisfi stabl steadi state characterist . therefor , paramet select differ state is wide applic from point of view of improv of transient respons . thi studi , present novel paramet select method pid control base load chang predict of neural network improv transient respons of dc dc convert . present method , suitabl pid paramet select with neural network . thi neural network is train predict load chang from output voltag of dc dc convert advanc . from predict result of neural network , pid paramet chang optim one after load chang occur . addit , refer modif with anoth neural network , which is train modifi refer valu of pid control , is also adopt simultan obtain more effect improv of transient respons . from evalu result , confirm that our present method contribut obtain an effect improv of transient respons compar convent pid control .
