protein conform motion model use sep cma es mass transfer , cma es , protein conform , conform motion problem of protein conform motion model is an open problem structur comput biolog . it is difficult solv it use method of molecular dynam or quantum physic becaus these method deal with time interv of nanosecond or microsecond , while conform motion take time of millisecond order . addit , these method not take extern forc into consider . cope with these problem , numer approxim and coars grain method develop , which use idea from geometri and motion planning.w present new coars grain method of model protein motion between two given conform . method is base optim of cost function similar one mong kantorovich mass transfer problem . optim is perform use sep cma es , which make run time of an iter linear number of amino acid protein . propos method is compar with some of exist method sever molecul . it is shown that result of propos method more accur than of other method .
