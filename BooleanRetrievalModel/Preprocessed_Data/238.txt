iter grammar base framework discov variabl length time seri motif grammar , time seri analysi , approxim algorithm , nois reduct , compress algorithm , algorithm design and analysi , data mine recent year , find repetit similar pattern time seri becom popular problem . these pattern call time seri motif . recent studi show that use grammar compress algorithm find repeat pattern from symbol time seri hold promis discov approxim motif with variabl length . howev , grammar compress algorithm tradit design string compress . therefor , exist work grammar induct not fulli util much avail inform that use enhanc perform of algorithm . thi work , an iter framework base grammar induct is propos . each iter , revis oper call nois reduct oper is appli revis symbol time seri string base rule return from base grammar induct algorithm . our experi , show that propos work find motif of same qualiti , with much faster run time compar state of the art variabl length exact motif discoveri algorithm real world time seri data .
