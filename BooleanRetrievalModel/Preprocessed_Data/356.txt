home applianc energi disaggreg use low frequenc data and machin learn classifi smart energi , smart hous , disaggreg , non intrus load monitor , neural network , featur select home applianc monitor provid use inform about applianc usag , which use better inform user about their consumpt habit and promot energi conserv . howev , meter load is cost prohibit . instead , mani tri disaggreg load from aggreg power measur . exist approach that requir submet high resolut power signal of individu applianc dure train and test , impract and econom infeas . thi paper , introduc low cost approach home applianc monitor base observ made singl circuit . our approach consist of three step . first , appli neural network classifi segment input power signal . then , appli anoth classifi label each segment an individu applianc or multipl applianc . final , iter disaggreg multi applianc segment with classifi previou step . our propos approach is evalu two experi . first experi use fulli label public dataset consist of 1,211 segment from 25 student bedroom univers campu . second experi use 1,563 segment from redd public dataset . evalu show that our approach accur detect those applianc that domin energi consumpt ( overal accuraci of 86.6 % and 91.2 % , respect ) . also present an in depth analysi of failur and conjectur whi they harder detect .
