model mutual inform between voiceprint and optim number of mel frequenc cepstral coeffici voic discrimin featur select , voiceprint , mfcc , inform theori thi paper , studi relationship between voiceprint and optim number of mel frequenc cepstral coeffici ( mfcc ) which yield highest classif accuraci of voic discrimin . voiceprint is model sub mfcc matrix with first d number of mfcc . model relationship through inform theori and formul it mutual inform maxim problem subject probabl constraint . solut of thi optim problem provid optim number of mfcc , which yield highest classif accuraci of voic discrimin , togeth with confid level . thi studi is dictat by need understand use of mfcc , which prolifer sinc it invent discrimin voic . evalu our model by compar leav one out cross valid ( loocv ) result of usual multi class classifi , supervis learn gaussian mixtur model ( slgmm ) , with set of spoken word and solo acapella sing . experiment result show that our model is more comprehens featur select criteria mfcc than de facto techniqu , loocv .
