privaci preserv solut bipartit rank problem bipartit rank problem , privaci preserv , data mine thi paper , propos an effici solut privaci preserv of bipartit rank algorithm . bipartit rank problem consid find function that rank posit instanc ( dataset ) higher than neg one . howev , one common concern exist scheme is privaci of individu dataset . that is , one ( e.g . , research ) need access record of individu dataset order run algorithm . thi privaci concern put limit use of sensit person data such analysi . rimarc ( rank instanc by maxim area under roc curv ) algorithm solv bipartit rank problem by learn model rank instanc . part of model , it learn weight each featur by analyz area under receiv oper characterist ( roc ) curv . rimarc algorithm is shown more accur and effici than it counterpart . thu , use thi algorithm build block and provid privaci preserv version of rimarc algorithm use homomorph encrypt and secur multi parti comput . our propos algorithm let data owner outsourc storag and process of it encrypt dataset semi trust cloud . then , research get result of hi her queri ( learn rank function ) dataset by interact with cloud . dure thi process , neither research nor cloud learn ani inform about raw dataset . prove secur of propos algorithm and show it effici via experi real data .
