switch and restart algorithm with exponenti restart strategi object select and it runtim analysi runtim analysi , object select , algorithm select , onlin select , ea+rl there exist optim problem with target object , which is optim , and sever extra object , which may or may not help optim process . thi paper consid case when it is possibl find an optimum of target object by optim either target object or singl extra object . an algorithm is present that use singl instanc of an underli singl object optim algorithm optim differ object differ iter and restart optim algorithm between optim differ object . thi algorithm expect run time of most 4 k min_o t_o until an optimum of target object is found , where t_o is expect run time of underli optim algorithm find an optimum of target object by optim object o. an impact of not use restart between iter is also discuss .
