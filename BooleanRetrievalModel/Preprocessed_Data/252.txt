demograph group predict base smart devic user recognit gestur demograph group predict , machin learn , pca , lda , knn classif model propos novel demograph group predict mechan smart devic user base upon recognit of user gestur . core idea of our propos approach is util data from varieti of intern environment sensor devic predict use demograph inform . order achiev thi object , an applic with sever intuit user interfac wa implement and use captur user data . result present here base upon data from fifti user . these captur data integr or fuse , pre process , analyz , and use train data supervis machin learn predict approach . data reduct method base upon princip compon analysi ( pca ) and linear discrimin analysi ( lda ) . pca lda were implement reduc data featur dimens and improv k nearest neighbor ( knn ) supervis classif predict . result of our experi indic that high accuraci is achiev from thi method . best of our knowledg , thi is first research that use user recognit gestur predict multipl demograph group .
