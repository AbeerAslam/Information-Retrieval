power varianc test nonstationar complex valu signal stochast process , time seri analysi , nonstationari process , bootstrap , oceanographi propos novel algorithm test hypothesi of nonstationar complex valu signal . implement use both bootstrap and fast fourier transform such that algorithm effici implement o ( nlogn ) time , where n is length of observ signal . test procedur examin second order structur and contrast observ power varianc i.e . variabl of instantan varianc over time with expect characterist of stationari signal gener via bootstrap method . our algorithm procedur is capabl of learn differ type of nonstationar , such jump or strong sinusoid compon . illustr util of our test and algorithm through applic turbul flow data from fluid dynam .
