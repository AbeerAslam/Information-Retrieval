an edg less approach horizon line detect horizon line detect , skylin extract , support vector machin , convolut neural network , dynam program horizon line is promis visual cue which exploit robot local or visual geo local . promin approach horizon line detect reli edg detect pre process step which is inher non stabl approach due paramet choic and underli assumpt . present novel horizon line detect approach which use machin learn and dynam program ( dp ) extract horizon line from classif map instead of an edg map . key idea is assign classif score each pixel , which interpret likelihood of pixel belong horizon line , and repres classif map multi stage graph . use dp , horizon line extract by find path that maxim sum of classif score . contrast edg map which typic binari ( edg vs no edg ) and contain gap , classif map continu and contain gap , yield significantli better solut . use classif map instead of edg map allow remov certain assumpt such horizon is close top of imag or that horizon form straight line . purpos of these assumpt is bia dp solut but they fail produc good result when they not valid . demonstr our approach three differ data set and provid comparison with tradit approach base edg map . although our train set is compris of veri small number of imag from same locat , our result illustr that our method gener well imag acquir under differ condit and geograph locat .
