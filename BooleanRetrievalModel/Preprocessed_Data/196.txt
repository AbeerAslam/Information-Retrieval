learn common metric homogen task traffic flow predict metric learn , cm knn , traffic flow predict , common metric learn , lcm nearest neighbor base nonparametr regress is classic data driven method traffic flow predict intellig transport system ( it ) . perform of those model depend heavili similar or distanc metric use search nearest neighborhood . metric learn algorithm been develop learn distanc metric from data recent year . real world transport applic , multipl forecast task set sinc there lot of road section and detector point traffic network . previou work tend learn onli one global metric use task or learn multipl local metric each task which may lead under fit or over fit problem . balanc these two kind of method and improv gener of learn metric , propos common metric learn algorithm under intuit that homogen task tend similar local metric . then learn common metric use common metric knn ( cm knn ) traffic flow predict . experiment result show that our algorithm learn common metric reason and cm knn method traffic flow predict outperform other compet method .
