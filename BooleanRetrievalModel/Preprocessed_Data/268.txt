android malwar detect : build use represent malwar classif , logist regress , random project , android , dimension reduct , featur select problem of proactiv detect android malwar proven challeng one . challeng stem from varieti of issu , but recent literatur shown that thi task is hard solv with high accuraci when onli restrict set of featur , like permiss or similar fix set of featur , use . opposit approach of includ avail featur is also problemat , it caus featur space grow beyond reason size . thi paper focu find an effici way select repres featur space , preserv it discrimin power unseen data . go beyond tradit approach like princip compon analysi , which is too heavi larg scale problem with million of featur . particular show that mani featur group that extract from android applic packag , like featur extract from manifest file or string extract from dalvik execut ( dex ) , should filter and use classif separ . our propos dimension reduct scheme is appli each group separ and consist of raw string preprocess , featur select via log odd and final appli random project . with size of featur space grow exponenti function of train set 's size , our approach drastic decreas size of featur space of sever order of magnitud , thi turn allow accur classif becom possibl real world scenario . after reduc dimension use featur group light weight ensembl of logist classifi . evalu propos classif scheme real malwar data provid by antiviru vendor and achiev state of the art 88.24 % true posit and reason low 0.04 % fals posit rate with significantli compress featur space balanc test set of 10,000 sampl .
