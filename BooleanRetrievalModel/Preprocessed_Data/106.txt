featur select use gustafson kessel fuzzi algorithm high dimens data cluster featur select , inform weight , fuzzi cluster , cluster valid perform of object function base fuzzi cluster algorithm depend shape and volum of cluster , initi of cluster algorithm , distribut of data object , and number of cluster data . featur select is also one of most import issu high dimens data cluster specif bioinformat , data mine , signal process etc . , where featur space dimens tend veri larg , make both cluster and classif task veri difficult . it is evid that featur subset need success perform given cluster and recognit task depend discriminatori qualiti of chosen featur . propos new hybrid approach address featur select , base inform weight , which take into account membership degre of featur perform by gustafson kessel fuzzi algorithm . purpos is effici achiev high degre of dimension reduct and enhanc or maintain predict accuraci with select featur . candid featur subset gener by use iter featur elimin procedur which result estim of featur inform weight . use both supervis and unsupervis method order evalu cluster abil of featur subset .
