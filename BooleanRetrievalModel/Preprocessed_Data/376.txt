lectur vdeo index use boost margin maxim neural network video index , imag match , convolut neural network , boost thi paper present novel approach lectur video index use boost deep convolut neural network system . index is perform by match high qualiti slide imag , which text is either known or extract , lower resolut video frame with possibl nois , perspect distort , and occlus . propos deep neural network integr with boost framework compos of two sub network target featur extract and similar determin perform match . train network is given input pair of slide imag and candid video frame imag and produc similar between them . boost framework is integr into our propos network dure train process . experiment result show that propos approach is much more capabl of handl occlus , spatial transform , and other type of nois when compar with known approach .
