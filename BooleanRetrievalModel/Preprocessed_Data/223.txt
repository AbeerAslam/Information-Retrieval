neural network base kidney segment from mr imag : preliminari result kidney segment , neural network , mr imag autom and robust kidney segment from medic imag sequenc is veri difficult task particularli becaus of gray level similar of adjac organ , partial volum effect and inject of contrast media . addit these difficulti , variat kidney shape , posit and gray level make autom identif and segment of kidney harder . also , differ imag characterist with differ scanner much more increas difficulti of segment task . therefor , thi paper , present an autom kidney segment method by use multi layer perceptron base approach that adapt paramet accord imag handl these challeng problem . effici term of segment perform is achiev by use inform from previous segment kidney imag . propos approach is also effici term of requir process time sinc it doe not includ pre process and train stage , which veri time consum . moreov , unsupervis segment approach elimin common problem of most neural network base approach that is depend of result chosen data train stage .
