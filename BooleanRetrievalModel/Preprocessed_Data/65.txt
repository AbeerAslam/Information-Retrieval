uncertainti quantifi matrix complet use bayesian hierarch matrix factor bayesian analysi , probabilist matrix factor , uncertainti quantif low rank matrix complet method been success varieti of set such recommend system . howev , most of exist matrix complet method onli provid point estim of miss entri , and not character uncertainti of predict . thi paper , propos bayesian hierarch probabilist matrix factor ( bhpmf ) model 1 ) incorpor hierarch side inform , and 2 ) provid uncertainti quantifi predict . former yield signific perform improv problem of plant trait predict , key problem ecolog , by leverag taxonom hierarchi plant kingdom . latter is help identifi predict of low confid which turn use guid field work data collect effort . gibb sampler is design infer model . further , propos multipl inherit bhpmf ( mi bhpmf ) which work with gener direct acycl graph ( dag ) structur hierarchi , rather than tree . present comprehens experiment result problem of plant trait predict use largest databas of plant trait , where bhpmf show strong empir perform uncertainti quantifi trait predict , outperform state of the art base point estim . further , show that bhpmf is more accur when it is confid , wherea error is high when uncertainti is high .
