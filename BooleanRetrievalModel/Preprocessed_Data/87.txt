increment svd insight into wind gener vector , matrix decomposit , approxim method , singular valu decomposit , wind speed thi paper , formul problem of predict wind gener one of stream data analysi . want understand if it is possibl use weather data time window just befor current time gain insight into how wind gener might behav time interv just after current time . specif , use singular valu decomposit of weather data , and how that number of singular valu and largest singular valu use predict magnitud of chang gener near futur . analysi use an increment algorithm base slide window reduc comput cost .
