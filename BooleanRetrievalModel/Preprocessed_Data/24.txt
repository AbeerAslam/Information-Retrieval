improv perform problem with few label data by reus stack auto encod transfer learn , deep learn , artifici neural network deep architectur been use transfer learn applic , with aim of improv perform of network design given problem by reus knowledg from anoth problem . thi work address transfer of knowledg between deep network use classifi of digit and shape imag , consid case where onli set of class label , or onli data distribut , chang from sourc target problem . our main goal wa studi how perform of knowledg transfer between such problem would affect by vari number of layer be retrain and amount of data use that retrain . gener , reus network train differ label set led better result than reus network train differ data distribut . particular , reus less class network train more class wa benefici virtual ani amount of train data . case , retrain onli one layer save time consist led poorer perform . result obtain when retrain upright digit network train rotat digit rais hypothesi that transfer learn could use better deal with imag classif problem which onli small amount of label data is avail train .
