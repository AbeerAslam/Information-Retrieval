predict of sunspot number use minimum error entropi cost base kernel adapt filter kernel method , error entropi , inform theoret learn sever algorithm adapt filter base minim of mean squar error ( mse ) cost function . howev , mse is just second order statist and henc doe not captur entir inform about probabl distribut of error system . an inform theoret altern is use minimum error entropi ( mee ) cost function . adapt algorithm base thi criterion been develop and shown superior compar mse counterpart . thi work , kernel version of some of these method design and test predict annual sunspot number . sunspot number is number of visibl darker region solar surfac and been shown instrument model space weather , state of ionospher , climat anomali and even global warm . compar perform studi of variou linear and kernel algorithm , train with both mee and mse criteria , predict such chaotic non linear time seri is present thi paper . experiment result clearli show advantag of mee base kernel design which is per expect given that it advantag of be non linear along with be abl deriv maximum inform from error distribut .
