perform analysi of major vote combin multipl classifi system multipl classifi system , major vote rule , probabl of classif error combin rule multipl classifi system ( mc ) play central role shape their perform ( classif error probabl ) . mani theoret work develop predict perform use differ combin rule . some of develop work assum that classifi ' output independ , howev practic an ensembl of classifi show depend behavior between each other . thi work , theoret model is deriv estim misclassif error probabl of mc base major vote combin . deriv , assum that each classifi produc it output an estim of posterior class probabl that gaussian distribut . addit , assum that each classifi two class , and output of classifi depend and ident distribut . valid our model use comput simul . result show that ensembl perform is highli sensit class varianc while exhibit smoother behavior against class mean . also , result show that correl among classifi ' output increas , probabl of classif error degrad exponenti . trend continu until perform reach behavior of singl classifi regardless of number of base classifi use ensembl . propos model provid better understand of behavior of major vote combin mc .
