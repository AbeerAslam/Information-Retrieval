diagnosi of bear defect induct motor by fuzzi neighborhood densiti base cluster fault diagnosi , bear defect , induct motor , fuzzi neighborhood densiti base cluster thi paper , supervis fuzzi neighborhood densiti base cluster approach is propos fault diagnosi of induct motor ' bear . propos approach make use of label data regard actual class of faulti and fault free case , order train fuzzi neighborhood densiti base cluster algorithm supervis manner , by resort an invas weed optim algorithm that aim minim an error base object function . propos classifi properli classifi multi class data with complex and various shape decis boundari among differ class of fault and fault free state , and is robust against nois . thi is due mainli fact that classifi is construct use fuzzi neighborhood densiti base cluster method , which is not sensit geometr shape of cluster featur space .
