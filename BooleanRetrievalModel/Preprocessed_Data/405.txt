anomali detect multivari non stationari time seri automat dbm diagnosi anomali detect , non stationari time seri , automat diagnosi , reconstruct error , statist process control , transfer learn anomali detect databas manag system ( dbmss ) is difficult becaus of increas number of statist ( stat ) and event metric big data system . thi paper , i propos an automat dbm diagnosi system that detect anomali period with abnorm db stat metric and find causal event period . reconstruct error from deep autoencod and statist process control approach appli detect time period with anomali . relat event found use time seri similar measur between event and abnorm stat metric . after train deep autoencod with dbm metric data , efficaci of anomali detect is investig from other dbmss contain anomali . experi result show effect of propos model , especi , batch tempor normal layer . propos model is use publish automat dbm diagnosi report order determin dbm configur and sql tune .
