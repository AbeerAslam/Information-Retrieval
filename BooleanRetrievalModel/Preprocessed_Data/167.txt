finit gamma mixtur model base discrimin learn framework mixtur model , gamma distribut , gener learn , svm , object recognition,3d shape , video event it is well known that classif task approach use either gener model or discrimin one . while goal of gener approach is learn class condit densiti , main goal of discrimin techniqu is learn decis boundari directli without take into account class condit densiti . classic supervis learn , would usual repres given object ( an imag , instanc ) by vector of d real valu featur and then select given gener or discrimin approach perform classif . mani applic , howev , object repres by set ( or ) bag of vector . recent develop machin learn , along with power comput tool , enabl research develop more sophist model handl such applic use so call hybrid gener discrimin model . main idea is base exploit advantag of both famili of model . thu , success of such an approach depend choic of an appropri discrimin techniqu and suitabl gener one . goal of thi paper is develop hybrid gener discrimin framework base support vector machin and gamma mixtur . particular , focu gener of kernel when exampl ( imag , instanc ) structur data ( i.e . describ by set of vector ) model by gamma mixtur . experiment result real world challeng applic , name 3d shape class recognit , object categor , and video event analysi , show effect of propos framework .
