intellig bu stop identif use smartphon sensor intellig system , bu transport , machin learn , gp , sensor intellig transport system built by develop model that learn from collect transport data . data collect and implement of such system is often costli , and few countri support such system their transport budget . place where maintain currenc and accuraci of inform is difficult , mani problem aris . instanc , chennai , india , real time bu transit data is not maintain , there is proper commun about bu schedul , bu stop not regularli updat and inconsist inform about bu stop is observ transport author 's websit . interest develop model identifi bu stop from trajectori situat where accur and current inform is not avail and traffic condit challeng , such chennai , india . develop simpl yet easili access android mobil applic ( app ) collect gp trace of bu rout . use our app collect gp trajectori data from baltimor , maryland , place where there facil access up to date inform about bu stop . also collect gp trajectori from chennai , india . then develop model use machin learn techniqu identifi bu stop from collect trajectori . experiment evalu our model by train it baltimor dataset and test it chennai dataset , achiev test accuraci between 85 90 % . thi is compar accuraci of 95 % achiev by both train and test chennai dataset . thi illustr that our approach is effect help maintain an accur and current transport inform system resourc constraint environ .
