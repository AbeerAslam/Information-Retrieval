lacova : tree base multi label classifi use label covari split criterion multi label learn , decis tree , covari matrix , split criteria deal with multipl label is supervis learn problem of increas import . multi label classifi face challeng of exploit correl between label . while exist work these correl often model global , thi paper use divid and conquer approach of decis tree which enabl take local decis about how best model label depend . result algorithm establish tree base multi label classifi call lacova which dynam interpol between two well known baselin method : binari relev , which assum label independ , and label powerset , which learn joint label distribut . key idea is split criterion base label covari matrix that node , which allow us choos between horizont split ( branch featur ) and vertic split ( separ label ) . empir result 12 data set show strong perform of propos method , particularli data set with hundr of label .
