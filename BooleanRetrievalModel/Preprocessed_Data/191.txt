augment interact evolut with multi object optim interact evolutionari comput , multi object evolutionari algorithm , novelti search , serendipit discoveri decept fit landscap grow concern field of evolutionari comput . recent work demonstr that incorpor human insight with short term autom evolut synergist effect that eas decept and acceler discoveri of solut . while human evalu provid rich insight into domain , they fatigu easili . previou work reduc number of human evalu by evolv divers set of candid via intermitt search novelti . while success evolv solut decept maze domain , it lack abil measur solut qualiti that human evalu implicitli identifi import . key insight of thi paper that multi object evolutionari algorithm ( moea ) foster divers and that non domin set serv surrog novelti while measur user prefer data . thi new approach , call pareto optim assist interact evolutionari comput ( poa iec ) , leverag human intuit by allow user identifi candid non domin set that they feel promis . interestingli , experiment result demonstr that poa iec find solut significantli fewer evalu than previou approach , and that non domin set contain significantli more novel behavior than domin set . thi way , poa iec simultan leverag human insight while quantifi their prefer .
