geometr pde weight graph semi supervis classif equat , databas , standard , label , vector , imag process , classif algorithm thi paper , consid adapt of two partial differenti equat ( pde ) weight graph , p laplacian and eikon equat , semi supervis classif task . these equat discret analogu of well known geometr pde , which wide use imag process . while p laplacian graph wa intens use data classif , few work relat eikon equat data classif . method illustr through semi supervis classif task databas , where compar two algorithm . result show that these method perform well regard state of the art and applic task of semi supervis classif .
