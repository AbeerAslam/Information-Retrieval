stack method hierarch classif hierarch classif , bioinformat , stack hierarch classif ( hc ) consist of classif problem whose class structur hierarch fashion . mani problem address by hc , special decent amount of work dealt with bioinformat relat problem such protein function predict ( pfp ) and transpos element ( te ) classif . both of them still challeng task hc due noisi and imbalanc natur of dataset . countermeasur , stack is an ensembl method capabl of gener knowledg from mani classifi . thi work , propos three stack method hc and evalu it perform pfp and te dataset . our result show that , when compar regular stack and state of art method from literatur , our method abl obtain superior or competit perform .
