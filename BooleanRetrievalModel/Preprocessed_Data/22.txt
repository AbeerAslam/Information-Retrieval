cyclic contrast diverg learn algorithm high order rbm high order rbm , cyclic contrast diverg learn , gradient approxim , converg , upper bound restrict boltzmann machin ( rbm ) , special case of gener boltzmann machin and typic probabilist graphic model , attract much attent recent year due it power abil extract featur and repres distribut underli train data . most commonli use algorithm learn rbm is call contrast diverg ( cd ) propos by hinton , which start markov chain data point and run chain onli few iter get low varianc estim . howev , when refer high order rbm , sinc there interact among it visibl layer , gradient approxim via cd learn usual becom far from log likelihood gradient and even may caus cd learn fall into infinit loop with high reconstruct error . thi paper , new algorithm name cyclic contrast diverg ( ccd ) is introduc learn high order rbm . unlik standard cd algorithm , ccd updat paramet accord each visibl layer turn , by borrow idea of cyclic block coordin descent method . evalu perform of propos ccd algorithm , regard high order rbm learn , both algorithm ccd and standard cd theoret analyz , includ converg , estim upper bound and both bias comparison , from which superior of ccd learn is reveal . experi of handwritten digit classif task mnist dataset perform . experiment result show that ccd is more applic and consist outperform standard cd both converg speed and perform .
