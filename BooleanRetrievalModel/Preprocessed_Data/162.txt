decay potenti field neural network : an approach parallel topolog indic map exemplar self organ parallel , recal of data , potenti map methodolog aim make sens or connect from hard data . human mind is abl effici and quickli process imag through visual cortex , part due it parallel natur . basic kohonen self organ featur map ( sofm ) is one exampl of map methodolog class of neural network that doe thi veri well . optim result is nice map neural network repres of data set , howev sofm not translat parallel architectur veri well . problem stem from neighborhood that establish between neuron , creat race condit updat win neuron . propos fulli parallel map architectur base loos sofm call decay potenti field neural network ( dpfnn ) . show that dpfnn use neuron that comput uncoupl but symbol link . through analysi show thi allow neuron reach converg with have onli passiv data depend each other , oppos hazard gener direct depend . creat thi network close reflect effici and speed of parallel approach , with result that rival or exceed those of similar topolog network such sofm .
