cluster distribut short time seri with dens pattern time seri cluster , short time seri , distribut data cluster cluster of gene with similar tempor profil is an import task gene express data analysi . current approach cluster of spars gene express data with tempor inform suffer from their least quadrat complex number of cluster , number of gene , or both , and not distribut . thi paper , present first distribut and densiti base approach short time seri cluster , call dtscluster , which is suitabl gene express data . dtscluster identifi dens pattern distribut dataset and use them gener time seri cluster . compar experiment result reveal that dtscluster is scalabl dataset size with linear complex time and space , and outperform other repres approach term of cluster valid with silhouett index well . distribut scenario also open opportun collabor data mine between differ gene express data holder .
