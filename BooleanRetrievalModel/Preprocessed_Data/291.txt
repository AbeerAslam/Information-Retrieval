automat algorithm select comput softwar use machin learn result , meta algorithm , superfunct , algorithm , choic , automat , select , mapl , mathematica , runtim , improv comput softwar program , such mapl and mathematica , heavili reli superfunct and meta algorithm select optim algorithm given task . these meta algorithm may requir intens mathemat proof formul , incur larg comput overhead , or fail consist select best algorithm . machin learn demonstr promis altern automat algorithm select by eas design process and overhead while also attain high accuraci select . case studi result superfunct , train neural network is abl select best algorithm out of four avail 86 % of time mapl and 78 % of time mathematica . when use replac pre exist meta algorithm , neural network bring about 68 % runtim improv mapl and 49 % improv mathematica . random forest , k nearest neighbor , and both linear and rbf kernel svm also compar neural network model , latter of which offer best perform out of test machin learn method .
