bilevel paramet tune strategi of partial connect ann optim , neuron , tune , topolog , train , time seri analysi , network topolog partial connect ann with evolv topolog ( pannet ) is non fulli connect recurr neural network with proper number of context node . structur of network along with connect weight determin through evolutionari process of custom genet algorithm . thi paper , develop an evolutionari bilevel optim procedur tune hyper paramet of pannet . upper level , an evolutionari algorithm optim hyper paramet , while custom genet algorithm is train pannet lower level optim . sinc execut lower level optim each candid hyper paramet requir high comput cost , fit function approxim is perform use regress model base random forest method . propos procedur provid more flexibl choos hyper paramet , and gener smaller network with more accuraci predict .
