new video steganographi algorithm base multipl object track and ham code video steganographi , motion base multipl object track , ham code , embed effici , eembed payload modern world , video steganographi becom popular option secret data commun . perform of ani steganographi algorithm is base embed effici , embed payload , and robust against attack . thi paper , propos new video steganographi algorithm base multipl object track algorithm and ham code . propos algorithm includ four differ stage . first , secret messag is preprocess , and ham code ( n , k ) appli order produc an encod messag . second , motion base multipl object track algorithm is appli cover video order identifi region of interest of move object . third , process of embed 3 and 6 bit of encod messag into 1 lsb and 2 lsb of rgb pixel compon is perform motion region video use foreground mask . fourth , process of extract secret messag from 1 lsb and 2 lsb each rgb compon of move region is accomplish . experiment result of propos video steganographi algorithm demonstr high embed effici and high embed payload .
