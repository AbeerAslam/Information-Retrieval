learn score system patient mortal predict intens care unit via orthogon match pursuit logist regress , intens care unit , mortal rate predict , score system , orthogon match pursuit problem of predict outcom of patient intens care unit ( icu ) is of great import critic care medicin , and wide implic qualiti control icu . domin approach thi problem been use an icu score system such acut physiolog and chronic health evalu ( apach ) system and simplifi acut physiolog score ( sap ) system , comput certain sever score patient from set of clinic observ , and appli logist regress model thi score obtain an estim of probabl of mortal patient , owe their simplic , these method wide use by clinician . howev , exist icu score system , which built from fix set of patient data , often perform poorli when appli patient popul with differ characterist , also , with chang patient characterist , score system built from given patient data set becom suboptim over time . moreov , most of these score system built use semi autom procedur , make it difficult adapt them new patient popul . thu there is huge need adapt method that automat learn predict model from given set of patient data . inde , there been much work recent year appli variou machin learn method thi problem , howev these method learn differ represent from score system prefer by clinician . thi work , develop machin learn method base orthogon match pursuit that automat learn score system type model , which enjoy benefit of both world : like other machin learn method , it is adapt , like standard score system , it use represent that is easi clinician understand . experi real world patient data set show that our method outperform standard icu score system , and perform least well other machin learn method thi problem .
