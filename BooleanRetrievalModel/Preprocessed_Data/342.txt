local and global data spread base index determin number of cluster dataset number of cluster dataset , cluster valid , cluster , compact measur of cluster , distinct measur of cluster most of cluster algorithm sensit input paramet and produc differ cluster result differ input paramet same dataset . number of method and indic been propos valid result of cluster process . most commonli use approach cluster valid base intern indic . thi paper , propos new cluster valid index ( arspread index ) purpos of cluster valid and determin number of cluster present dataset . local and global data spread base approach is propos measur compact of cluster . distinct measur that is base penalti function is incorpor propos index . conduct thorough comparison of five commonli known indic with propos index and provid summari of experiment perform of differ indic . experiment result show that propos new index perform better than commonli known indic .
