semi supervis cluster approach semant slot label natur languag process , semant slot label , semi supervis learn , interact system work train semant slot label use natur languag process applic typic either reli larg amount of label input data , or assum entir unlabel input . former techniqu tend costli appli , while latter is often not accur it supervis counterpart . here , present semi supervis learn approach that automat label semant slot set of train data and aim strike balanc between depend label data and predict accuraci . essenc of our algorithm is cluster claus base similar function that combin lexic and semant inform . present experi that compar differ similar function both our semi supervis set and fulli unsupervis baselin . while semi supervis learn expectedli outperform unsupervis learn , our result show that thi effect observ base veri few train data instanc and that increas size of train data doe not lead better perform , and that lexic and semant inform contribut differ differ domain so that cluster base both type of inform offer best generalis .
