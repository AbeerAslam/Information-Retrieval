automat gender classif system from finger 2d : 4d ratio and comparison of success with use differ algorithm classif algorithm , 2d:4d , mass death , automat gender estim , index and ring finger ratio high rate of correct of inform determin ident of corps mass death such disast aircraft , high speed train or sea accid and fire , where peopl damag an extent that they not identifi , and method follow main element . thi studi , dataset wa form by take index finger , ring finger , height and age of 67 turkish men and 56 turkish women . dataset wa use identifi sex of person and thu , inform that could reveal ident of inform wa obtain . lad tree algorithm , naiv bay algorithm , knn algorithm and c4.5 algorithm were tri dataset . c4.5 algorithm highest rate of success determin sex with rate of 93 % . therefor , automat sex classif wa made use c4.5 algorithm . studi reveal that 2d:4d ratio vari differ sex and race . move from these studi , sex wa determin from ratio of index finger ring finger . when compar with exist studi literatur differ race , it wa prove that race also determin . it wa found that left hand provid higher success finger ratio use identifi sex compar right hand .
