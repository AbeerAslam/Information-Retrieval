autom optim architectur of deep convolut neural network imag recognit convolut neural network ( cnn ) , hyperparamet optim , deconvolut network ( deconvnet ) , nelder mead algorithm ( nma ) recent advanc deep convolut neural network ( cnn ) led impress progress comput vision , especi imag classif . cnn involv numer hyperparamet that identifi network 's structur such depth of network , kernel size , number of featur map , stride , pool size and pool region etc . these hyperparamet signific impact classif accuraci of cnn . select proper cnn architectur is differ from one dataset anoth . an empir approach is often use determin near optim valu of these hyperparamet . some recent work tri optim techniqu hyperparamet select well . thi paper , develop framework hyperparamet optim that is base new object function that combin inform from visual of learn featur map via deconvolut network , and accuraci of train cnn model . nelder mead algorithm ( nma ) is use guid cnn architectur toward near optim hyperparamet . our propos approach is evalu cifar 10 and caltech 101 benchmark . experiment result indic that final architectur of cnn obtain by our object function outperform other approach term of accuraci . it is shown that our optim framework contribut increas depth of network , shrink size of stride and pool size obtain best cnn architectur .
