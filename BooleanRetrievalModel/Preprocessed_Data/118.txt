evalu uncertainti of bayesian network queri respons by use joint probabl distribut bayesian network , machin learn , effect sampl size , varianc of queri respons , approxim infer bayesian network is power tool repres pattern insid past data . it use predict futur by calcul posterior probabl of futur event . machin learn techniqu that construct bayesian network from past data automat well develop recent year . if consid past data sampl set from an origin probabilist distribut , `` learn `` process is actual tri reproduc origin probabilist distribut from sampl set . therefor , finit of size of sampl set will bring uncertainti reproduc paramet of construct bayesian network . when construct bayesian network is use predict futur , uncertainti of reproduc paramet will transfer uncertainti of queri respons . here , queri respons is posterior probabl that interest . evalu uncertainti of queri respons is critic some strict industri applic . previou research propos method evalu uncertainti . consequ is shown varianc of queri respons . howev , convent method need work togeth with bucket elimin , an exact infer method . therefor , convent method not deal with larg bayesian network that use real applic becaus of it calcul cost . propos new approach calcul uncertainti of queri respons by use joint probabl distribut thi research . propos method work with ani infer method . therefor , it give an approxim evalu even when bayesian network is larg by use an approxim infer method . investig accuraci of our propos method , six well use public bayesian network use test case . by compar approxim result with exact result , an averag error of 13.60 % is got .
