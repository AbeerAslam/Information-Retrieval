onlin learn algorithm collect lda topic model , onlin learn , variat infer , multi corpora , data mine collect latent dirichlet alloc ( c lda ) is propos an extens of lda simultan model multipl corpora from differ domain order overcom bia of individu corpu . howev , with larg volum of document collect from variou sourc , it becom challeng achiev fast converg c lda . high time complex of c lda limit it applic real world task . luckili , onlin learn shown promis speed converg of lda . thi paper , propos explor onlin learn collect lda ( ovclda ) . first develop an effici variat infer algorithm collect lda and then extend it onlin learn framework . perform experi with variou real world corpora . experiment result shown that ovclda learn compar topic with c lda and better than onlin lda , and achiev compar comput effici with onlin lda and is much more effici than c lda .
