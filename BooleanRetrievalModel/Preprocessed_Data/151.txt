detect of ssh brute forc attack use aggreg netflow data intrus detect , brute forc , machin learn , aggreg netflow ssh brute forc attack is one of most preval attack comput network . these attack aim gain inelig access user ' account by tri plenti of differ password combin . detect of thi type of attack network level overcom scalabl issu of host base detect method . thi paper , provid machin learn approach detect of ssh brute forc attack network level . sinc extract discrimin featur ani machin learn task is fundament step , explain process of extract discrimin featur detect of brute forc attack . incorpor domain knowledg about ssh brute forc attack well analysi of repres collect of data defin featur . collect real ssh traffic from campu network . also gener some fail login data that legitim user who forgotten hi her password produc normal traffic that similar ssh brute forc attack traffic . our inspect collect brute forc netflow data and manual produc ssh fail login data show that netflow featur not discrimin enough discern brute forc traffic from fail login traffic produc by legitim user . introduc an aggreg of netflow extract proper featur build machin learn model . our result show that model built upon these featur provid excel perform detect of brute forc attack .
