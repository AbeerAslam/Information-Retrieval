limit of convolut neural network recogn neg imag convolut neural network , neg imag convolut neural network ( cnn ) achiev state of the art perform varieti of comput vision task , particularli visual classif problem , where new algorithm report achiev or even surpass human perform . thi paper , examin whether cnn capabl of learn semant of train data . thi end , evalu cnn neg imag , sinc they share same structur and semant regular imag and human classifi them correctli . our experiment result indic that when train regular imag and test neg imag , model accuraci is significantli lower than when it is test regular imag . thi lead us conjectur that current train method not effect train model gener concept . then introduc notion of semant adversari exampl transform input that semant repres same object , but model doe not classifi them correctli and present neg imag one class of such input .
