nois predict and time domain subtract approach deep neural network base speech enhanc speech enhanc , deep neural network , nois estim , speech qualiti , speech intellig deep neural network ( dnn ) recent been success appli speech enhanc task ; howev , low signal to nois ratio ( snr ) perform of dnn base speech enhanc system remain less than desir . thi paper , studi an approach dnn base speech enhanc base nois predict . three speech enhanc model base nois predict propos , and their perform is compar that of convent spectral map model seen and unseen nois test . object test result show that propos nois predict model perform well enhanc speech qualiti seen nois condit and enhanc high snr speech signal . they also perform well enhanc speech intellig both seen and unseen nois condit , but not outperform convent model qualiti metric unseen nois condit . further analysi of enhanc speech signal is undertaken explain observ result .
