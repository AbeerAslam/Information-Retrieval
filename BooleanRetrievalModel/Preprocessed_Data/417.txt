model of fuzzi logic control of maximum power point tracker base artifici neural network grid connect pv system , dc dc boost convert , maximum power point tracker , fuzzi logic control , artifici neural network , back propag algorithm , hybrid neuron fuzzi grid connect photovolta system ( gcpv ) becom more use system renew energi . sever research been carri out improv effici and decreas of energi loss . one of import compon use increas effici is dc dc boost convert . thi paper , new hybrid model is propos control dc dc convert , thi new control is built fuzzi logic control ( flc ) and artifici neural network ( ann ) . pathway taken build model is divid into three step , first step is gener data base flc , next step is choos an ann structur model flc and last step is test and valid of obtain model . phase of build an ann is achiev by supervis learn base back propag algorithm . thi algorithm is use train ann model by search of optim weight and threshold that been minim root mean squar error between flc output and ann model . valid test wa perform with variou irradi valu between both intellig control and classic p & o algorithm simultan .
