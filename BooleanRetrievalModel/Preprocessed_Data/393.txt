compar transfer learn and tradit learn under domain class imbal transfer learn , domain class imbal , tradit machin learn transfer learn is subclass of machin learn , which use train data ( sourc ) drawn from differ domain than that of test data ( target ) . transfer learn environ is character by unavail of label data from target domain , due data be rare or too expens obtain . howev , there exist abund label data from differ , but similar domain . these two domain like differ distribut characterist . transfer learn algorithm attempt align distribut characterist of sourc and target domain creat high perform classifi . thi paper provid compar perform analysi between stateof the art transfer learn algorithm and tradit machin learn algorithm under domain class imbal condit . domain class imbal condit is character by sourc and target domain have differ class probabl , which creat margin distribut differ between sourc and target data . statist analysi is provid show signific of result .
