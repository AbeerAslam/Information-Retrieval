exampl specif densiti base match kernel scene classif use support vector machin kernel , support vector machin , visual , histogram , featur extract , semant , maximum likelihood estim thi paper , propos exampl specif densiti base match kernel ( esdmk ) classif of scene imag repres set of local featur vector . propos kernel is comput between pair of exampl , repres set of local featur vector , by match estim of exampl specif densiti comput everi local featur vector those two exampl . thi work , number of local featur vector of an exampl among k nearest neighbor of local featur vector is consid an estim of exampl specif densiti . minimum of two exampl specif densiti , one each exampl , local featur vector is consid match score . esdmk is then comput sum of match score comput everi local featur vector pair of exampl . also propos spatial esdmk ( sesdmk ) includ spatial inform present scene imag while match pair of scene imag . each of scene imag is divid spatial into fix number of region . then sesdmk is comput combin of region specif esdmk that match correspond region . studi perform of support vector machin ( svm ) base classifi use propos esdmk scene classif and compar with that of svm base classifi use state of the art kernel set of local featur vector .
