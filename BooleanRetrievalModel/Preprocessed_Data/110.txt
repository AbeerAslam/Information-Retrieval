learn multi valu biolog model with delay influenc from time seri observ dynam system , multi valu model , boolean network , delay , markov ( k ) , learn from interpret transit , induct logic program delay effect import model biolog system , and time boolean network been propos such framework . yet it is not an easi task design such boolean model with delay precis . recent , an attempt learn time boolean network been made ribeiro et al 2015 framework of learn state transit rule from time seri data . howev , thi approach still two limit : ( 1 ) maximum delay given input algorithm , ( 2 ) possibl valu of each state is assum boolean , i.e . , twovalu . thi paper , extend previou learn mechan overcom these limit . propos an algorithm learn multi valu biolog model with delay influenc by automat tune delay . delay is determin so minim explain necessari influenc . merit of our approach is then verifi benchmark come from dream4 challeng .
