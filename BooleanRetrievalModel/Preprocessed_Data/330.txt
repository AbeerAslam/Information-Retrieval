machin learn optimum ct predict qpcr machin learn , qpcr , ct predict , algorithm , sigmoid introduct of fluoresc base real time pcr ( rt pcr ) is increasingli use detect multipl pathogen simultan and rapidli by gene express analysi of pcr amplif data . pcr data is analyz often by set an arbitrari threshold that intersect signal curv it exponenti phase if it exist . point which curv cross threshold is call threshold cycl ( ct ) posit sampl . other , when such cross of threshold doe not occur , sampl is identifi neg . thi simpl and arbitrari howev not an elag definit of ct valu sometim lead conclus that either fals posit or neg . therefor , purpos of thi paper is present stabl and consist altern approach that is base machin learn definit and determin of ct valu .
