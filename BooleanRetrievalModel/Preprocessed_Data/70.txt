leverag machin learn algorithm perform onlin and offlin highway traffic flow predict traffic predict , onlin learn , flow forecast , stochast gradient descent advanc traffic manag system ( atm ) heavili depend traffic flow or equival travel time estim . main goal of thi paper is accomplish two differ algorithm perform offlin and onlin traffic flow forecast . multi layer perceptron ( mlp ) , which is train yearli data , is util mid term offlin predict . princip compon analysi ( pca ) is employ speed train process . thi model also serv baselin . stochast gradient descent deploy onlin forecast . both algorithm predict flow of locat down trunk highway ( target point ) use histori of flow of sever locat ahead of target point twin citi metro area minneapoli .
