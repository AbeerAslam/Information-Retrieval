audio signal reconstruct use cartesian genet program evolv artifici neural network ( cgpann ) audio signal , reconstruct , neural network , signal process propos novel audio signal reconstruct model that make use of non linear estim algorithm call cartesian genet program evolv artifici neural network ( cgpann ) . cgpann estim non linear graph of audio signal with much better accuraci than it counterpart : interpol and extrapol . compar them term of snr improv and abil deal with disput data . unlik other convent reconstruct algorithm , propos algorithm restor signal which is damag 50 % by nois . state of the art approach reconstruct an audio signal util machin learn is present thi paper . perform of algorithm is evalu by measur it signal to nois ( snr ) improv and differ between origin and reconstruct signal term of mean absolut percentag error ( mape ) . snr improv of 20 db is record singl point estim with 25 % miss sampl , 19 db multi point ( 5 ) estim which half of data is miss and 16 db signal with random variabl nois .
