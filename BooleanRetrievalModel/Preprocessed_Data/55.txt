wifi local mobil robot base random forest and gplvm wifi slam , mobil robot , random forest , gplvm , khepera prolifer of wifi network attract mani research commun employ wifi signal estim locat of mobil devic indoor environments.in thi paper , propos local framework that is capabl of determin locat of mobil robot indoor limit area . propos framework exploit random forest algorithm both classif and regress techniqu , which use build cooper supervis local model . local model train offlin base train data that contain measur of wifi signal strength and locat of these measur . also propos an extens our framework use gaussian process latent variabl model ( gplvm ) , which give our framework abil build subject local model which n't requir ani prior knowledg about ground truth of local place . our experiment evalu of propos framework use kheperaiii mobil robot one testb show that it give high accuraci , where calcul mean local error is 36 cm .
