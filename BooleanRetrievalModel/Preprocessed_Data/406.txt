rbf firmlp architectur digit recognit firmlp , neural network , handwritten digit recognit , mnist , mnist variat , pattern recognit finit impuls respons multilay perceptron ( firmlp ) is multilay perceptron where static weight been replac by finit impuls respons filter . herebi , it repres model spatio tempor process . thi paper present tempor process neural network which is base firmlp , but some layer been replac by tempor radial basi function ( rbf ) unit . train algorithm use tempor backpropag not just adapt weight but also find center and width of rbf layer well . perform comparison been done task of handwritten digit ecognit by use mnist and mnist variat databas .
