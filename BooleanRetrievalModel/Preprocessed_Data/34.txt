post process associ rule use network and transduct learn network , associ rule , prune , post process , label propag associ is wide use find relat among item given databas . howev , find interest pattern is challeng task due larg number of rule that gener . tradit , thi task is done by post process approach that explor and direct user interest rule of domain . some of these approach use user 's knowledg guid explor accord what is defin ( thought ) interest by user . howev , thi definit is done befor process start . therefor , user must know what may and what may not interest him her . thi work propos gener associ rule post process approach that extract user 's knowledg dure post process phase . that way , user doe not need prior knowledg databas . that , propos approach model associ rule network , use it measur suggest rule classifi by user and , then , propag these classif entir network use transduct learn algorithm . therefor , thi approach treat post process problem classif task . experi were carri out demonstr that propos approach reduc number of rule explor by user and direct him her potenti interest rule of domain .
