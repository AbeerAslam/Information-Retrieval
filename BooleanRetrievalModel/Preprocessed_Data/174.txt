recogn human activ from raw acceleromet data use deep neural network activ recognit , deep neural network , featur learn , acceleromet data activ recognit from wearabl sensor data been research mani year . previou work usual extract featur manual , which were hand design by research , and then were fed into classifi input . due blind of manual extract featur , it wa hard choos suitabl featur specif classif task . besid , thi heurist method featur extract could not gener across differ applic domain , becaus differ applic domain need extract differ featur classif . there wa also work that use auto encod learn featur automat and then fed featur into k nearest neighbor classifi . howev , these featur were learn an unsupervis manner without use inform of label , thu might not relat specif classif task . thi paper , recommend deep neural network ( dnn ) activ recognit , which automat learn suitabl featur . dnn overcom blind of hand design featur and make use of preciou label inform improv activ recognit perform . did experi three publicli avail dataset activ recognit and compar deep neural network with tradit method , includ those that extract featur manual and auto encod follow by k nearest neighbor classifi . result show that deep neural network could gener across differ applic domain and got higher accuraci than tradit method .
