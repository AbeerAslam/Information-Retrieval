car follow markov regim classif and calibr car follow model , regim classif , model calibr , driver behavior , markov switch model car follow behavior recent gain much attent due it wide varieti of applic . thi includ accid analysi , driver assess , support system , and road design . thi paper , present model that leverag markov regim switch model classifi variou car follow regim . detect car follow regim then mine calibr paramet of driver depend driver 's current drive regim . two stage markov regim switch model is util detect differ car follow regim . first stage discrimin normal car follow regim from abnorm one , while second stage classifi normal car follow regim their fine grain regim like brake , acceler , stand , free flow , and normal follow . genet algorithm is then employ observ driver data each car follow regim optim car follow model paramet valu of driver each regim . experiment evalu of propos model use real dataset show that it detect up normal ( rare and short time ) event . addit , it infer switch process dynam such expect durat , probabl of move from one regim anoth and switch paramet of each regim . final , model is abl accur calibr paramet of driver accord their drive regim , so achiev better understand of driver behavior and better simul of drive situat .
