investig transfer learner robust domain class imbal transfer learn , domain class imbal , tradit machin learn , class imbal transfer learn environ is character by machin learn algorithm be train with data from one domain ( sourc domain ) and be test data from differ domain ( target domain ) . transfer learn scenario , class probabl of sourc domain may differ from class probabl of target domain , which is refer `` domain class imbal `` . domain class imbal is differ from `` class imbal `` . class imbal refer condit of singl domain have unequ class probabl . tradit machin learn , train and test data drawn from singl domain . effect of class imbal tradit machin learn well studi , howev , issu of domain class imbal field of transfer learn receiv littl research attent . thi paper provid compar perform test of state of the art transfer learn algorithm , use wide rang of domain class imbal combin . detail discuss rel perform of differ algorithm , with statist valid , is present differ domain class imbal scenario .
