anytim exploit of straggler synchron stochast gradient descent distribut sgd , stochast gradient descent , parallel sgd , straggler thi paper propos an approach parallel synchron stochast gradient descent ( sgd ) that term anytim gradient . anytim gradient is design exploit work complet by slow comput node or straggler . mani approach work complet by these node , while onli partial , is discard complet . maintain synchron our approach , each comput epoch is of fix durat , and end of each epoch , worker send updat paramet vector master mode combin . master weight each updat by amount of work done . anytim gradient scheme is robust both persist and non persist straggler and requir prior knowledg about processor abil . show that scheme effect exploit straggler and outperform exist method .
