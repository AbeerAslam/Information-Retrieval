toward sleep apnea screen with an under the mattress ir uwb radar use machin learn obstruct apnea , hypopnea , ultra wide band radar thi work , appli machin learn investig effect of an impuls radio ultra wide band ( ir uwb ) radar panel , an under the mattress configur , detect apnea event subject known obstruct sleep apnea ( osa ) . consid collect of featur , some novel and some inspir by featur that work well sleep apnea detect use other type of sensor ( i.e . , not ir uwb ) . extract featur , collect total of 25 hour of data from four subject they slept through night . data includ digit sampl of ir uwb radar return signal and score polysomnograph ( psg ) , which is gold standard and measur larg number of physiolog paramet well equip sleep laboratori . normal and apnea epoch were extract from ir uwb data correspond normal and apnea epoch psg data . statist featur were deriv from these extract epoch and linear discrimin classifi wa train . use cross valid , found that classifi an accuraci of around 70 % detect of apnea and normal epoch . novel aspect of thi project involv process and investig of differ method featur extract data obtain from real apnea subject and suggest that radar , when pair with other under the mattress sensor might provid an effect screen devic conveni form factor .
