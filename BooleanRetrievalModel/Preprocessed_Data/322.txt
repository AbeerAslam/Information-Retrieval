hybrid machin learn approach plan safe trajectori complex traffic scenario hybrid learn algorithm , trajectori plan road traffic,3d convnet plan of safe trajectori with intervent both later and longitudin dynam of vehicl huge potenti increas road traffic safeti . main challeng develop of such algorithm consider of vehicl nonholonom constraint and effici term of implement , so that algorithm run real time vehicl . recent introduc augment cl rrt algorithm is an approach that use analyt model trajectori plan base brute forc evalu of mani longitudin acceler profil find collis free trajectori . algorithm consid nonholonom constraint of vehicl complex road traffic scenario with multipl static and dynam object , but it requir lot of comput time . thi work propos hybrid machin learn approach predict suitabl acceler profil critic traffic scenario , so that onli few acceler profil use with augment cl rrt find safe trajectori while reduc comput time . thi is realiz use convolut neural network variant , introduc 3d convnet , which learn spatiotempor featur from sequenc of predict occup grid gener from predict of other road traffic particip . these learn featur togeth with hand design featur of ego vehicl use predict acceler profil . simul perform compar brute forc approach with propos approach term of effici and safeti . result show vast improv term of effici without harm safeti . addit , an extens augment cl rrt algorithm is introduc find trajectori with low sever of injuri , if collis is alreadi unavoid .
