automat algorithm recognit of sourc code use machin learn algorithm recognit , machin learn , featur recognit codebas softwar project get larger , reach rang of million of line of code , need comput aid program comprehens grow . defin one of task of program comprehens algorithm recognit : given piec of sourc code from file , identifi algorithm thi code is implement , such brute forc or dynam program . most research thi area is make use of pattern match , which involv much human effort and is of question accuraci when structur and semant of program chang . thu , thi paper propos let go of defin pattern , and make use of simpler featur , such count of variabl and count of differ construct recogn algorithm . then feed these featur classif algorithm predict class or type of algorithm use thi sourc code . show through experiment result that our propos method achiev good improv over baselin .
