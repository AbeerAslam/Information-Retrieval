tempor link predict use time seri of quasi local node similar measur social network analysi , evolv network , node similar , link predict , narx neural network evolv network , which compos of object and relationship that chang over time , preval mani real world domain and becom an signific research topic recent year . most of previou link predict studi neglect evolut of network over time and mainli focu predict futur link base static featur of node and link . howev , real world network complex dynam structur and non linear vari topolog featur , which mean that both node and link of network may appear or disappear . these dynam of network make link predict more challeng task . overcom these difficulti , link predict such network must model nonlinear tempor evolut of topolog featur and link occurr inform of network structur simultan . thi articl , propos novel link predict method base narx neural network evolv network . our model first calcul similar score base quasi local measur each pair of node differ snapshot of network and creat time seri each pair . then , narx network is effect appli predict of futur node similar score by use past node similar and node connect . propos method is test dblp coauthorship network . it is shown that combin time inform with node similar and node connect improv link predict perform larg extent .
