explor impact of clone refactor test code size object orient softwar object orient softwar , clone refactor , sourc code attribut , test code size , metric , linear regress , machin learn algorithm thi paper aim explor impact of clone refactor test code size , term of number of oper , object orient softwar . investig three research question : ( 1 ) impact of clone refactor three import sourc code attribut ( coupl , complex and size ) that relat unit testabl of class , ( 2 ) impact of clone refactor test code size , and ( 3 ) variat after clone refactor sourc code attribut that most import impact test code size . use linear regress and three popular machin learn techniqu ( i.e . , k nearest neighbor , nave bay and random forest ) develop predict and explanatori model . use data collect from an open sourc java softwar system ( ant ) that been refactor use clone refactor techniqu . analys indic that there is strong and posit relationship between clone refactor and reduct of test code size . result show that : ( 1 ) sourc code attribut of refactor class been significantli improv , ( 2 ) test code size of refactor class been significantli reduc , and ( 3 ) variat of test code size more influenc by variat of complex and size of refactor class compar coupl .
