event base weight updat learn infinit spike train spike neural network ( snn ) , spike event , spike train , supervis learn , multilay network supervis learn method spike neural network either abl learn spike train singl neuron or abl learn first spike multilay feedforward connect set . first group of learn method not use comput benefit of hidden layer neuron wherea second group of learn method not exploit inform transfer potenti of spike train . although , there been few effort learn spike train multilay feedforward set spike neural network , comput cost of these method increas when spike train is consid long period . present spike event base weight updat strategi that is abl learn spike train pattern multilay feedforward spike neural network and is effici and scalabl learn spike train pattern indefinit period of time . will compar thi method with relev spike neural network learn algorithm base differ benchmark dataset and show efficaci of thi event base weight updat learn .
