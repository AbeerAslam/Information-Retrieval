predict of spei use mlr and ann : case studi wilson promontori station victoria multi linear regress model , artifi neural network model , standard precipit index , drought model predict of drought is of major import climat relat studi , hydrolog engin , wildlif or agricultur studi . thi studi explor abil of two machin learn method predict 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 month standard precipit and evapotranspir index ( spei ) wilson promontori station eastern australia . two method multipl linear regress ( mlr ) and artifici neural network ( ann ) . data driven model were base combin of input variabl : mean precipit , mean , maximum and minimum temperatur and evapotranspir , data between 1915 and 2012. two perform metric were use compar perform of optimum mlr and ann model : coeffici of determin ( r2 ) and root mean squar error ( rmse ) . it wa found that ann provid greater accuraci than mlr forecast 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 month spei .
