studi of use of complex measur similar search process adopt by knn algorithm time seri predict time seri predict , similar base method , machin learn , data mine last two decad , with rise of data mine process , there is an increas interest adapt of machin learn method support time seri non parametr model and predict . non parametr tempor data model perform accord local and global approach . most of local predict data strategi base k nearest neighbor ( knn ) learn method . thi paper propos modif of knn algorithm time seri predict . our propos differ from literatur by incorpor three techniqu obtain amplitud and offset invari , complex invari , and treatment of trivial match . evalu propos method with six complex measur , order verifi impact of these measur project of futur valu . besid , face our method with two machin learn regress algorithm . experiment comparison were perform use 55 data set , which avail icmc usp time seri predict repositori . our result indic that develop method is competit and use of complex invari distanc measur gener improv predict perform .
