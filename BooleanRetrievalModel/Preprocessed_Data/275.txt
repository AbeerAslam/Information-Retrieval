an led base indoor local system use k mean cluster indoor local , k mean , unsupervis learn , cluster thi paper introduc novel visibl light posit ( vlp ) system use an un supervis machin learn approach . two transmitt consist of light emit diod ( led ) which modul with 1 khz and 2.5 khz sinusoid signal respect . receiv end , receiv signal strength ( rss ) is calcul and spars grid cube is construct by measur light intens differ locat . bilinear interpol is then appli creat dens grid of read which is use train of hierarch k mean cluster system . given queri led read , train cluster use posit estim by minim distanc between read and cluster centroid . experiment result show that an averag accuraci of 0.31m achiev room with dimens of 4.3 4 4 m3 . further compar perform of two other cluster method : k medoid and fuzzi c mean howev signific improv over kmean cluster is found .
