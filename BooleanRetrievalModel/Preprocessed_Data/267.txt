toward an onlin anomali intrus detect system base deep learn intrusiondetect , dbn , rbm , attack , cyber secur , neural network , machin learn , data mine past twenti year , progress intrus detect been steadi but slow . biggest challeng is detect new attack real time . thi work , deep learn approach anomali detect use restrict boltzmann machin ( rbm ) and deep belief network implement . our method use one hidden layer rbm perform unsupervis featur reduct . result weight from thi rbm pass anoth rbm produc deep belief network . pre train weight pass into fine tune layer consist of logist regress ( lr ) classifi with multi class soft max . implement deep learn architectur c++ microsoft visual studio 2013 and use darpa kddcup'99 dataset evalu it perform . our architectur outperform previou deep learn method implement by li and salama both detect speed and accuraci . achiev detect rate of 97.9 % total 10 % kddcup'99 test dataset . by improv train process of simul , also abl produc low fals neg rate of 2.47 % . although defici kddcup'99 dataset well understood , it still present machin learn approach predict attack with reason challeng . our futur work will includ appli our machin learn strategi larger and more challeng dataset , which includ larger class of attack .
