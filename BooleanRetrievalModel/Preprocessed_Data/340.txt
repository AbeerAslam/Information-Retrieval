an oblivi rout base power flow calcul method loss minim of smart power network : theoret perspect larg scale network flow , loss minim , oblivi rout scheme , power system power loss minim play an import role appropri oper of power network . line power loss occur when power is transmit through line of network due permitt of line medium . transmiss loss may increas dispatch cost of of obtain power flow base market contract . henc , independ system oper should use loss minim method facilit implement of contract power transact . loss minim also will improv secur and stabil of power network . thi paper , present novel loss minim scheme base oblivi network design , refer oblivi rout base power flow method . method is built bottom up oblivi network rout scheme which offer multipl path from sever sourc ( gener unit ) specif destin ( electr load demand ) . although there is limit inform regard other line flow and current statu of network , rout scheme mathemat guarante that power flow solut is an approxim of optim solut with specif competit ratio . fact , our main focu is power flow calcul while optim power loss . compar with recent develop power flow method , our approach doe not depend network topolog and it perform both radial and non radial network is accur . henc , it is suitabl use propos approach larg scale loss minim while determin power flow . thi paper mainli focus theoret aspect of propos method . our method is base novel concept from comput scienc disciplin , provid suffici explan about preliminari of oblivi rout scheme .
