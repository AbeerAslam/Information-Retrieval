resampl base variabl select with lasso p > > n and partial linear model featur select , variabl select , big data , high dimension data , lasso regress , non linear linear model of regress function is wide use and perhap , most case , highli unrealist simplifi assumpt , when propos consist variabl select method larg and highli dimension dataset . thi paper , studi what happen from theoret point of view , when variabl select method assum linear regress function and underli ground truth model is compos of linear and non linear term , that is most partial linear . demonstr consist of lasso method when model is partial linear . howev , note that algorithm tend increas even more number of select fals posit partial linear model when given few train sampl . that is usual becaus valu of small group of sampl happen explain variat come from non linear part of respons function and nois , use linear combin of wrong predictor . demonstr theoret that fals posit like select by lasso method due small proport of sampl , which happen explain some variat respons variabl . show that thi properti impli that if run lasso sever slightli smaller size data replic , sampl without replac , and intersect result , like reduc number of fals posit without lose alreadi select true posit . propos novel consist variabl select algorithm base thi properti and show it outperform other variabl select method synthet dataset of linear and partial linear model and dataset from uci machin learn repositori .
