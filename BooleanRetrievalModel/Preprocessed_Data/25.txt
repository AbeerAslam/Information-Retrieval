an analysi of instanc select neural network improv train speed instanc select , neural network , train speed train artifici neural network ( ann ) is rel slow compar mani other machin learn algorithm . thi studi , focu instanc select improv train speed . first evalu effect of instanc select algorithm k nearest neighbor algorithm with ann . then analyz factor accuraci distanc from decis boundari , dens region , and class distribut , and propos new instanc select algorithm . discuss tradeoff between accuraci and train speed , and introduc measur tradeoff . our empir result real data set indic that our propos rdi is more effect with ann .
