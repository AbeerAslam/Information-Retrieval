adventur game with neural network control non play charact neural network , genet algorithm , web base game , neuroevolut thi paper present way evolv non play charact by control it through neural network , then use genet algorithm alter weight . previou neural network data provid popul from which select individu , and simul result allow rel rank that use fit function . treat select set of neural network weight binari sequenc , program use cross over and mutat creat new set of weight , which subsequ evalu . through thi process , find that program creat better set of neural network weight , and that rel rank allow comput control charact rang of difficulti level . implement thi experi part of game .
