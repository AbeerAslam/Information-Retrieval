compar gaussian mixtur model and hidden markov model classifi uniqu physic activ from acceleromet sensor data acceleromet , wavelet , pca , gmm , hmm , confus matrix with recent interest physic therapi through suffici physic activ , consider effort been made monitor and classifi daili human activ , especi peopl who need physic rehabilit . our previou studi , design classifi identifi 25 uniqu physic activ perform by 92 healthi particip between age of 20 and 65. thi studi , with use of geneactiv acceleromet monitor wide rang of daili activ , present learn approach identifi uniqu activ perform by vari group of particip with variou health condit . dataset is compris of 99 senior particip and 23 particip who significantli taller height than gener popul , perform 8 uniqu activ . extract 130 differ featur time and frequenc domain and select most effici featur with sequenti forward select algorithm . with two stage of classif , first is util combin similar class , and second determin final decis . test two classifi our learn approach , gaussian mixtur model ( gmm ) and hidden markov model ( hmm ) and compar their perform . improv gmm classifi from our previou studi and it shown more promis result thi dataset . achiev an accuraci of 88.92 % when classifi 8 uniqu activ with gmm and 93.5 % with hmm when classifi 7 activ .
