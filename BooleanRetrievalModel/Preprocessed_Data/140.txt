classif of evolv data stream with infinit delay label data stream , classif , delay label , extrem verif latenc , onlin cluster major of evolv data stream classif algorithm assum that actual label of predict exampl readili avail without ani time delay just after predict is made . howev , given high label cost , depend of an expert , limit data transmiss or even restrict impos by problem 's natur , there is larg number of real world applic which avail of actual label is infinit delay ( never avail ) . these case , it is necessari use of algorithm that doe not follow tradit process of monitor error rate detect chang data distribut and use most recent label data updat classif model . thi paper , propos method mclassif classifi evolv data stream with infinit delay label . our method is inspir use of micro cluster represent from onlin cluster algorithm . consid presenc of increment drift , our approach use distanc base strategi maintain micro cluster ' posit updat . an evalu sever synthet and real data show that mclassif achiev competit accuraci result state of the art method and adequ comput cost . main advantag of propos method is absenc of critic paramet that requir user 's prior knowledg , occur with rival method .
