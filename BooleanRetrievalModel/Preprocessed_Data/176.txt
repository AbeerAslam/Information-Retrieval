speaker adapt use speaker similar score dnn featur deep neural network , k nearest neighbor , phonem classif , featur learn , speaker adapt thi paper propos novel speaker adapt algorithm classifi speech base deep neural network ( dnn ) . adapt algorithm consist of two step . first step deep neural network is train use raw mel frequenc cepstral coeffici ( mfcc ) featur discov hidden structur data and employ activ of last hidden layer of dnn acoust featur . second step use nearest neighbor , an adapt algorithm learn speaker similar score base small amount of adapt data from each target speaker use dnn base acoust featur . base speaker similar score , classif is done use k nearest neighbor ( k nn ) classifi . novelti of thi work is that instead of modifi and re train dnn speaker adapt , which compris larg number of paramet and is comput expens , activ of learn dnn use project featur from mfcc spars dnn space , then speaker adapt is perform base similar ( i.e . nearest neighbor ) use k nn algorithm . with onli small amount of adapt data , it reduc number of phonem classif error timit dataset by 23 % . thi work also analyz impact of deep neural network architectur speaker adapt perform .
