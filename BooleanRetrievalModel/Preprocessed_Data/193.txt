investig new bootstrap approach of bag classifi account class imbal bioinformat dataset class imbal , bag , bootstrap approach , bioinformat one major challeng pose by bioinformat dataset is class imbal which occur when one class mani more instanc than other class ( es ) . it undesir effect classif perform is compound with fact that , gener , class with fewer instanc is class of interest . bag been util by practition field overcom challeng of class imbal and improv classif perform . our motiv thi studi is investig whether chang bootstrap step of bag classifi further improv their perform . specif , these modif bootstrap process take into account membership of class . perform an extens empir studi util four bootstrap approach within bag framework use three featur ranker along with four featur subset size and two base classifi across 15 imbalanc bioinformat dataset . three of these bootstrap approach were propos and implement by our research team thi studi . our result show that new approach improv perform over classic bootstrap approach , with balanc bag have highest perform , howev , observ increas perform not statist signific . recommend balanc bootstrap approach becaus it show most improv , term of frequenc of have highest perform , and it gener fulli balanc bootstrap dataset that account class imbal problem . uniqu of thi paper is propos and implement three innov bootstrap approach examin effect of these bootstrap process against classic one perform of bag classifi domain of bioinformat .
