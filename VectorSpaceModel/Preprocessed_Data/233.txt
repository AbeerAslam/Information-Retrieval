random forest with random projection impute missing gene expression data missing data imputation gene expression data random forest random projection measurement error or lack of proper experimental setup often result invalid or missing data gene expression study small sample size and cost of re running experiment present need an efficient missing data imputation technique this paper propose method based random forest using random projection data pre processing filter initial result using varying missing data proportion variety of real datasets show that imputation process based random forest performs equally well or better than k nearest neighbor support vector regression based method using random projection show that dimensionality of dataset reduced by 50 percent without affecting imputation process
