automated scoring of level of integrative complexity from text using machine learning integrative complexity aggression intervention system machine learning logistic regression support vector machine conceptual integrative complexity is construct developed political psychology and clinical psychology measure an individual ability consider different perspective particular issue and reach justifiable conclusion after consideration of said perspective integrative complexity ic is usually determined from text through manual scoring which is time consuming laborious and expensive consequently there is demand automating scoring which could significantly reduce time expense and cognitive resource spent process any algorithm that could achieve above with reasonable accuracy could assist development of intervention system reducing potential aggression system recruitment process and even training personnel improving group disparity corporate world this study used machine learning predict ic level from text achieved over 78 accuracy three way classification
