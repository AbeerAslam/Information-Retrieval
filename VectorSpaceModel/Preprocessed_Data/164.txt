sequence classification with neural conditional random field hybrid neurocrfs sequence classification proliferation of sensor device monitoring human activity generates voluminous amount of temporal sequence needing interpreted and categorized moreover complex behavior detection requires personalization of multi sensor fusion algorithm conditional random field crfs commonly used structured prediction task such part of speech tagging natural language processing conditional probability guide choice of each tag label sequence conflating structured prediction task with sequence classification task where different model provide different categorization of same sequence claim of this paper is that crf model also provide discriminative model distinguish between type of sequence regardless of accuracy of label obtained if calibrate class membership estimate of sequence introduce and compare different neural network based linear chain crfs and present experiment two complex sequence classification and structured prediction task support this claim
