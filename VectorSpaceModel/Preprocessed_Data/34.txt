post processing association rule using network and transductive learning network association rule pruning post processing label propagation association is widely used find relation among item given database however finding interesting pattern is challenging task due large number of rule that generated traditionally this task is done by post processing approach that explore and direct user interesting rule of domain some of these approach use user s knowledge guide exploration according what is defined thought interesting by user however this definition is done before process start therefore user must know what may and what may not interesting him her this work proposes general association rule post processing approach that extract user s knowledge during post processing phase that way user doe not need prior knowledge database that proposed approach model association rule network us it measure suggest rule classified by user and then propagates these classification entire network using transductive learning algorithm therefore this approach treat post processing problem classification task experiment were carried out demonstrate that proposed approach reduces number of rule explored by user and directs him her potentially interesting rule of domain
