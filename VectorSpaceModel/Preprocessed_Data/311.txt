early identification of vulnerable software component via ensemble learning vulnerability ensemble learning support vector machine mislabeled data software component which vulnerable being exploited need identified and patched employing any prevention technique designed purpose of detecting vulnerable software component early stage reduce expense associated with software testing process significantly and thus help building more reliable and robust software system although previous study demonstrated effectiveness of adapting prediction technique vulnerability detection feasibility of those technique is limited mainly because of insufficient training data set this paper proposes prediction technique targeting early identification of potentially vulnerable software component proposed scheme potentially vulnerable component viewed mislabeled data that may contain true but not yet observed vulnerability proposed hybrid technique combine support vector machine algorithm and ensemble learning strategy better identify potential vulnerable component proposed vulnerability detection scheme is evaluated using some java android application result demonstrated that proposed hybrid technique could identify potentially vulnerable class with high precision and relatively acceptable accuracy and recall
