uncertainty quantified matrix completion using bayesian hierarchical matrix factorization bayesian analysis probabilistic matrix factorization uncertainty quantification low rank matrix completion method been successful variety of setting such recommendation system however most of existing matrix completion method only provide point estimate of missing entry and not characterize uncertainty of prediction this paper propose bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix factorization bhpmf model 1 incorporate hierarchical side information and 2 provide uncertainty quantified prediction former yield significant performance improvement problem of plant trait prediction key problem ecology by leveraging taxonomic hierarchy plant kingdom latter is helpful identifying prediction of low confidence which turn used guide field work data collection effort gibbs sampler is designed inference model further propose multiple inheritance bhpmf mi bhpmf which work with general directed acyclic graph dag structured hierarchy rather than tree present comprehensive experimental result problem of plant trait prediction using largest database of plant trait where bhpmf show strong empirical performance uncertainty quantified trait prediction outperforming state of the art based point estimate further show that bhpmf is more accurate when it is confident whereas error is high when uncertainty is high
