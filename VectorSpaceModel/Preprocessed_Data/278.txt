density based data pruning method deep reinforcement learning correlation stability analysis learning artificial intelligence training road index standard present density based data pruning method deep reinforcement learning drl improve learning stability and long term memory rare situation method control density distribution experience pool by discarding high correlation data and preserving rare and unique data apply our method deep q network dqn and deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg testing discrete and continuous action space respectively evaluate our method path following task simulated physical environment compared other conventional method such first in first out fifo our method provides significant improvement performance and learning stability average cumulative reward is increased by 21 and standard deviation of cumulative reward over multiple trial is reduced by 80 addition long term memory improvement is shown agent remember and perform behavior corresponding past rare event
