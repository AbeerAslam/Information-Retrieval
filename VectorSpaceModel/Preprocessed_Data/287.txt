l1 norm principal component analysis via bit flipping anomaly detection data contamination genomic data l1 norm l2 norm principal component analysis outlier singular value decomposition subspace learning k l1 norm principal component l1 pc of data matrix x d n found optimally with cost o 2 nk general case and o n rank x k k 1 when rankx is constant with respect n 1 2 certainly real world application where n is large even latter polynomial cost is prohibitive this work present l1 bf novel near optimal algorithm that calculates k l1 pc of x with cost o ndmin n d n 2 k 4 dk 2 dnk 3 comparable that of standard l2 norm principal component analysis our numerical study illustrate that proposed algorithm attains optimality with very high frequency while same time it outperforms l1 pca metric any counterpart of comparable computational cost outlier resistance of l1 pc calculated by l1 bf is documented with experiment dimensionality reduction and genomic data classification disease diagnosis
