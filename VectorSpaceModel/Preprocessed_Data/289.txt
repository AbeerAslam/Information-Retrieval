comparing gaussian mixture model and hidden markov model classify unique physical activity from accelerometer sensor data accelerometer wavelet pca gmm hmm confusion matrix with recent interest physical therapy through sufficient physical activity considerable effort been made monitor and classify daily human activity especially people who need physical rehabilitation our previous study designed classifier identify 25 unique physical activity performed by 92 healthy participant between age of 20 and 65 this study with use of geneactiv accelerometer monitor wide range of daily activity present learning approach identify unique activity performed by varied group of participant with various health condition dataset is comprised of 99 senior participant and 23 participant who significantly taller height than general population performing 8 unique activity extracted 130 different feature time and frequency domain and selected most efficient feature with sequential forward selection algorithm with two stage of classification first is utilized combining similar class and second determines final decision tested two classifier our learning approach gaussian mixture model gmms and hidden markov model hmms and compared their performance improved gmm classifier from our previous study and it shown more promising result this dataset achieved an accuracy of 88 92 when classifying 8 unique activity with gmm and 93 5 with hmm when classifying 7 activity
