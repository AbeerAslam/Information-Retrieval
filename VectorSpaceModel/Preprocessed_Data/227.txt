resource allocation predictive modeling optimize virtual world simulator performance vertical scaling virtual world simulation based training predictive model distributed simulation virtual world simulation military training is an emerging domain such detailed analysis is required optimize performance simulator unfortunately due lack of extensive virtual world performance analysis simulator administrator often make arbitrary resource allocation support their environment and training scenario this paper provide lightweight predictive model that will used an automated dynamic resource allocation system popular three dimensional open sourced virtual world simulator opensimulator prior this investigation only opensimulator developer and user with extensive experience with platform could manually load balance server resource based anticipated usage now with proposed system and it predictive model simulator advance towards having an automated mechanism determine minimal critical resource that required support target number of concurrent user virtual world
