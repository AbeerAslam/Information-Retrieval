human action recognition based mocap information using convolution neural network convolutional neural network cnn motion capture mocap human action recognition is an important component semantic analysis of human behavior this paper propose an approach human action recognition based motion capture mocap information using convolutional neural network cnn distance based metric computed from mocap information of only three human joint used computation of feature range and temporal variation of these distance metric considered design of feature which discriminative action recognition convolutional neural network capable of recognizing local pattern is used identify human action from temporal variation of these feature which distorted due inconsistency execution of action across observation and subject experiment conducted berkeley mhad dataset demonstrate effectiveness of proposed approach
