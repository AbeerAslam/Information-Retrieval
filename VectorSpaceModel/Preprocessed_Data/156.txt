statistical downscaling of climate change scenario of rainfall and temperature over indira sagar canal command area madhya pradesh india statistical downscaling gcm data scenario generation canal command sdsm general circulation model gcms been employed by climate agency predict future climate change challenging issue with gcm output local relevance is their coarse spatial resolution of projected variable statistical downscaling model sdsm identifies relationship between large scale predictor i e gcm based and local scale predictands using multiple linear regression model this study sdsm wa applied downscale rainfall and temperature from gcms data from single station located indira sagar canal command area madhya pradesh india were used input of sdsm study included calibration and validation with large scale atmospheric variable encompassing ncep reanalysis data future estimation due climate scenario which is hadcm3 a2 result of downscaling experiment demonstrate that during calibration and validation stage sdsm model well acceptable regard it performance downscaling of daily rainfall and temperature future period 2010 2099 sdsm model estimated an increase total average annual rainfall and annual average temperature station this indicates that area of station considered will wet and humid future also mean temperature is projected rise 1 5 c 2 5 c present study area however model projection show rise mean daily precipitation with varying percentage month of july 0 59 2 09 and august 0 79 1 19 under a2 of hadcm3 model future period
