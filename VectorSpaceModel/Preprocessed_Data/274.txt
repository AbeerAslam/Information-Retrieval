consensus clustering resampling based method building radiation hybrid map radiation hybrid mapping clustering resampling building radiation hybrid rh map is challenging process traditional rh mapping technique very time consuming and not work well noisy datasets this presented research propose new approach that us resampling technique with consensus clustering technique filter out unreliable marker and build robust rh map short time main aim of using proposed approach is first reduce mapping computational complexity thus speeding mapping process and second filter out unreliable marker and map remaining reliable marker build robust map proposed approach map rh datasets four step follows 1 us jackknife resampling technique resample rh dataset and group resampled datasets into cluster 2 build consensus cluster and filter out unreliable marker 3 map consensus cluster 4 connects consensus cluster map form final map demonstrate performance of our proposed approach compare accuracy of constructed map with corresponding physical map also compare running time of our constructed map with carthagene tool map running time result show that proposed approach construct robust map comparatively very short time
