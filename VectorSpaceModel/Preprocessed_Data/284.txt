improving hsdpa traffic forecasting using ensemble of neural network neural network ensemble method forecasting accurate forecasting of data traffic demand is very crucial profitable operation of cellular data network because it help facilitating optimization and planning of network resource many machine learning regression model including support vector regression and abductive network been applied this problem but this paper study concept of ensemble method improving forecasting accuracy specifically cooperative ensemble training strategy using two optimization algorithm is proposed train neural network model trained model is characterized with good forecasting performance due exchange of experience and knowledge of two optimization algorithm during training process dataset consisting of 44160 recording of hourly high speed data packet access hsdpa data traffic which wa collected over period of 30 day from sixty different site of umts based cellular operator wa used evaluate performance of proposed method experimental result show superiority of neural network model trained with proposed ensemble training strategy over other state of the art method
