iteratively learning liver segmentation using probabilistic atlas preliminary result liver segmentation probabilistic atlas viscous reconstruction this work deal with concept of liver segmentation by using priori information based probabilistic atlas and segmentation learning based of previous step probabilistic atlas is here understood probability or membership map that tell how likely is that point belongs shape drawn from shape distribution hand devise procedure segment perfusion magnetic resonance liver image that combine both probabilistic atlas of liver and segmentation algorithm based global information of previous simpler segmentation step local information from close segmented slice and finally mathematical morphology procedure namely viscous reconstruction fill shape preliminary result of algorithm provided
