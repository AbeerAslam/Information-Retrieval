event prioritization and correlation based pattern mining technique correlation monitoring ip network electronic mail server business hidden markov model with growing deployment of host and network intrusion detection system increasingly large and complex communication network managing low level event from these system becomes critically important network multiple task which consist of multiple network service aiding execution of task an emerging track of security research focused event prioritization and correlation rank criticality of event and reduce number of low level event prioritize and correlate event ongoing task an enterprise network identified goal of network operator is protect ongoing task when security breach occurs prioritization of an event depends criticality of an ongoing task that is potentially threatened by event additionally order support network operator correlate event that target same task particular task may depend multiple network service and involve multiple network device so if one network service becomes unavailable other network service will affected over time since they unfortunately dependency detail often not documented and difficult discover by relying human expert knowledge order solve this problem network dependency analysis based network traffic is conducted rely pattern mining technique discover task monitored enterprise network formal description of identified task is provided and event prioritized and correlated based this model pattern mining based network dependency analysis algorithm is evaluated based real world network and three network that where created with network simulator
