classification of pollen grain image based an ensemble of classifier palynology pollen classification image descriptor classifier ensemble recognition of pollen grain is challenging task since they three dimensional structure with complex morphological characteristic palynologists responsible studying pollen spore and similar microscopic plant structure this work develop and analyze an automatic method classification of pollen grain image based set of feature and classifier prediction of different classifier fused into an ensemble rule of majority voting experiment conducted two datasets containing different type of pollen grain used demonstrate effectiveness of proposed approach
