recognizing human activity from raw accelerometer data using deep neural network activity recognition deep neural network feature learning accelerometer data activity recognition from wearable sensor data been researched many year previous work usually extracted feature manually which were hand designed by researcher and then were fed into classifier input due blindness of manually extracted feature it wa hard choose suitable feature specific classification task besides this heuristic method feature extraction could not generalize across different application domain because different application domain needed extract different feature classification there wa also work that used auto encoders learn feature automatically and then fed feature into k nearest neighbor classifier however these feature were learned an unsupervised manner without using information of label thus might not related specific classification task this paper recommend deep neural network dnns activity recognition which automatically learn suitable feature dnns overcome blindness of hand designed feature and make use of precious label information improve activity recognition performance did experiment three publicly available datasets activity recognition and compared deep neural network with traditional method including those that extracted feature manually and auto encoders followed by k nearest neighbor classifier result showed that deep neural network could generalize across different application domain and got higher accuracy than traditional method
