detection of abnormal human behavior using matrix approximation based approach abnormal event detection low rank approximation adaptive learning automatic detection of abnormal event is one of central task video surveillance this paper present matrix approximation based method detect abnormal human behavior our model behavior pattern is represented by motion matrix obtained through object tracking model typical motion associated with normal behavior with set of motion subspace computed through low rank matrix approximation then abnormal human behavior identified by motion deviation from representative subspace our method doe not require complicated classification procedure and fast detect abnormal event complex scene addition through adaptive learning module our model is built observed data and expanded by incorporating new behavior pattern during detection process result simulated surveillance video show effectiveness of our method
