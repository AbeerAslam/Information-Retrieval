support vector regression predicting enhancement duration of software project software engineering software enhancement duration prediction support vector egression statistical regression isbsg software engineering se been defined application of systematic disciplined quantifiable approach development operation and maintenance of software enhancement is type of software maintenance se involves software planning sp and sp includes prediction this study propose application of two type of support vector regression svr termed svr and svr predict duration of software enhancement svr is type of support vector machine which is machine learning technique two data set of software project were used training and testing svr and svr prediction accuracy of svr wa compared that of statistical regression based statistical test result showed that svr with linear kernel wa statistically better than that of statistical regression model when software project were enhanced mid range platform and coded programming language of third generation
