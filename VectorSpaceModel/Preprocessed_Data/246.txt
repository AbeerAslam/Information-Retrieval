infrared colorization using deep convolutional neural network neural network dnn cnn multi scale nir near infrared colorization bilateral filter this paper proposes method transferring rgb color spectrum near infrared nir image using deep multi scale convolutional neural network direct and integrated transfer between nir and rgb pixel is trained trained model doe not require any user guidance or reference image database recall phase produce image with natural appearance preserve rich detail of nir image it high frequency feature transferred estimated rgb image presented approach is trained and evaluated real world dataset containing large amount of road scene image summer dataset wa captured by multi ccd nir rgb camera which ensures perfect pixel pixel registration
