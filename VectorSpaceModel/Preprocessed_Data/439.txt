predictive model of hard drive failure based operational data predictive model hidden markov model support vector machine drive feature extraction training hard drive an essential component of modern data storage order reduce risk of data loss hard drive failure prediction method using self monitoring analysis and reporting technology attribute been proposed however these method were developed from datasets not necessarily representative of operational system this paper consider backblaze public dataset recent operational dataset from over 47 000 drive exhibiting hard drive heterogeneity with 81 model from 5 manufacturer an extremely unbalanced ratio of 5000 1 between healthy and failure sample and realworld loosely controlled environment observe that existing predictive model longer perform sufficiently well this dataset therefore selected machine learning classification method able deal with very unbalanced training set namely svm rf and gbt and adapted them specific constraint of hard drive failure prediction our result reach over 95 precision and 67 recall one year real world public dataset of over 12 million record with only 2586 failure
