diagnosis of bearing defect induction motor by fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering fault diagnosis bearing defect induction motor fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering this paper supervised fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering approach is proposed fault diagnosis of induction motor bearing proposed approach make use of labeled data regarding actual class of faulty and fault free case order train fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering algorithm supervised manner by resorting an invasive weed optimization algorithm that aim minimize an error based objective function proposed classifier properly classify multi class data with complex and variously shaped decision boundary among different class of fault and fault free state and is robust against noise this is due mainly fact that classifier is constructed using fuzzy neighborhood density based clustering method which is not sensitive geometrical shape of cluster feature space
