measuring and modelling delay robot manipulator temporally precise control using machine learning robot control automation machine learning algorithm latency and delay play an important role temporally precise robot control during dynamic task particular robot account inherent delay reach manipulated object time different type of occurring delay typically convoluted and thereby hard measure and separate this paper present data driven methodology separating and modelling inherent delay during robot control show how both actuation and response delay modelled using modern machine learning method resulting model used predict delay well uncertainty of prediction experiment two widely used robot platform show significant actuation and response delay standard control loop predictive model therefore used reason about expected delay and improve temporal accuracy during control approach easily used different robot platform
