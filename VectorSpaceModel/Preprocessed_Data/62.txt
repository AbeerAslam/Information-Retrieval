budgeted learning developing personalized treatment reinforcement learning budgeted learning bayesian active learning personalized treatment there is increased interest using patient specific information personalize treatment personalized treatment decision rule learned using data from standard clinical trial but such trial very costly run this paper explores use of budgeted learning technique design more efficient clinical trial by effectively determining which type of patient recruit each time throughout duration of trial propose bayesian bandit model and discus computational challenge and issue pertaining this approach compare our budgeted learning algorithm which approximately minimizes bayes risk using both simulated data and data modeled after clinical trial treating depressed individual with other plausible algorithm show that our budgeted learning algorithm demonstrated excellent performance across wide variety of situation
