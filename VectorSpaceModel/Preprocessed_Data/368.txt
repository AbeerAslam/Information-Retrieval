machine learning approach detecting sensor data modification intrusion wbans wban security data modification intrusion detection machine learning wireless body area network wbans widely used collecting and monitoring patient vital healthcare parameter such breathing heart function and muscle activity serious flaw of wbans is their vulnerability various security issue one of which is physical tampering of sensor transmission of invalid data by damaged or compromised sensor may lead incorrect diagnosis improper treatment and undesirable result this paper analyze blood glucose level sensor and propose machine learning algorithm that detects intentional and inadvertent data modification intrusion this type of sensor proposed algorithm us otsu s thresholding method and other statistical measure create feature that estimate boundary average deviation and pattern of sensor data feature vector then classified by support vector machine svm model with linear kernel and varying misclassification parameter experiment large real patient dataset show that proposed algorithm achieves 100 precision and 99 22 recall
