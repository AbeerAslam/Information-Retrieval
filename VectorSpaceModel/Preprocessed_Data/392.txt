effect of communication noncooperative multiplayer multi armed bandit problem multi armed bandit online learning game theory reinforcement learning consider decentralized stochastic multi armed bandit problem with multiple player case of different communication probability between player each player make decision of pulling an arm without cooperation while aiming maximize or reward but informs or neighbor end of every turn about arm he or she pulled and reward he or she got neighbor of player determined according an erdos rnyi graph with connectivity which is reproduced beginning of every turn consider i i d reward generated by bernoulli distribution and assume that player unaware about arm probability distribution and their mean value case of collision assume that only one of player who is randomly chosen get reward where others get zero reward study effect of degree of communication between player cumulative regret using well known algorithm ucb1 greedy and thompson sampling
