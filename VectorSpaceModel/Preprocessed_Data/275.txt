an led based indoor localization system using k mean clustering indoor localization k mean unsupervised learning clustering this paper introduces novel visible light positioning vlp system using an un supervised machine learning approach two transmitter consist of light emitting diode led which modulated with 1 khz and 2 5 khz sinusoidal signal respectively receiver end received signal strength rss is calculated and sparse grid cube is constructed by measuring light intensity different location bilinear interpolation is then applied create dense grid of reading which is used training of hierarchical k mean clustering system given query led reading trained cluster used position estimation by minimizing distance between reading and cluster centroid experimental result show that an average accuracy of 0 31m achieved room with dimension of 4 3 4 4 m3 further compared performance of two other clustering method k medoids and fuzzy c mean however significant improvement over kmeans clustering is found
