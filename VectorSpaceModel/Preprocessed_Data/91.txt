new algorithm adaptive online selection of auxiliary objective parameter control reinforcement learning multi objectivization evolutionary algorithm consider optimization problem where target objective should optimized some auxiliary objective used obtain optimum of target objective less number of objective evaluation call such auxiliary objective supporting one usually there is prior knowledge about property of auxiliary objective some objective obstructive well what is more an auxiliary objective both supporting and obstructive different stage of target objective optimization thus an adaptive online method of objective selection is needed earlier proposed method doing that which is based reinforcement learning this paper new algorithm adaptive online selection of optimization objective is proposed algorithm meet interface of reinforcement learning agent so it fit into previously proposed framework new algorithm is applied solving some benchmark problem with single objective evolutionary algorithm specifically leading one with onemax auxiliary objective is considered well mh iff problem experimental result presented proposed algorithm outperforms q learning and random objective selection considered problem
