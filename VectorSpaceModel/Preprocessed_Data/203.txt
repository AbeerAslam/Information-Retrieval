data driven method detect abnormal instance an electricity market electricity market data mining anomaly detection participant an electricity market expect fair transparent and open competition market surveillance administrator msa responsible monitoring market outcome investigate if they consistent with fundamental of electricity market it an immensely time consuming process with high amount of computation an electricity market with huge number of participant besides manual review of market operation may biased by involving human decision making process if this anomaly detection procedure done automatically then it great aid market surveillance process having an unbiased and prompt tool monitor market this paper an anomaly detection algorithm is proposed identify event of interest an electricity market this algorithm provides msa with tool detect instance electricity market when electricity price behavior deviate from normal expected regime these anomalous hour then analyzed further order diagnose reason
