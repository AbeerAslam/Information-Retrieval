fine grained opinion extraction with markov logic network opinion extraction markov logic network joint inference markov logic network joint inference framework that combine logical and probabilistic representation enable effective modeling of dependency that exist between different instance of data sample while it ability capture relational dependency make it an ideal framework predicting structure inherent many natural language processing nlp task it is arguably underused nlp especially comparison other joint inference framework such integer linear programming this paper present first markov logic model nlp task of fine grained opinion extraction that exploit factuality lexicon when evaluated standard evaluation corpus our approach surpasses state of the art approach performance
