noise prediction and time domain subtraction approach deep neural network based speech enhancement speech enhancement deep neural network noise estimation speech quality speech intelligibility deep neural network dnns recently been successfully applied speech enhancement task however low signal to noise ratio snr performance of dnn based speech enhancement system remains less than desirable this paper study an approach dnn based speech enhancement based noise prediction three speech enhancement model based noise prediction proposed and their performance is compared that of conventional spectral mapping model seen and unseen noise test objective test result show that proposed noise prediction model perform well enhancing speech quality seen noise condition and enhancing high snr speech signal they also perform well enhancing speech intelligibility both seen and unseen noise condition but not outperform conventional model quality metric unseen noise condition further analysis of enhanced speech signal is undertaken explain observed result
