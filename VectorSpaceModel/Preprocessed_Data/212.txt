robust vehicle tracking using perceptual hashing algorithm feature extraction vehicle context target tracking binary code discrete cosine transforms robustness vehicle tracking significant computer vision using machine learning method allows vehicle comprehend it immediate environment and therefore enhances intelligence of vehicle and safety of vehicle occupant propose novel tracking algorithm that work robustly under challenging circumstance such road scene where several kind of appearance and motion change of tracking object occur our algorithm is based perceptual hashing algorithm pha and color low frequency and rotation information considered by mean of pha our tracker generates single identification each frame sliding window produce series of candidate between consecutive frame so that new position of tracking object updated by comparing binary code of candidate and identification experiment quantitative and qualitative result expressed by center location error cle and voc overlap ratio vor compared advanced tracker present pha tracker show it robustness when confronting violent change of noise illumination background clutter and part occlusion which demonstrates it state of the art performance field of dynamic vehicle tracking
