learning coordinate with deep reinforcement learning double pong game artificial intelligence deep reinforcement learning multi agent system cooperative system this paper discusses emergence of cooperative and coordinated behavior between joint and concurrent learning agent using deep q learning multi agent system ma arise variety of domain collective effort is one of main building block of many fundamental system that exist world and thus sequential decision making under uncertainty collaborative work is one of important and challenging issue intelligent cooperative multiple agent however decision cooperation highly sophisticated and complicated because agent may certain shared goal or individual goal achieve and their behavior is inevitably influenced by each other therefore attempt explore whether agent using deep q network dqn learn cooperative behavior use double pong game an example and investigate how they learn divide their work through iterated game execution our approach agent jointly learn divide their area of responsibility and each agent us it own dqn modify it behavior also investigate how learned behavior change according environmental characteristic including reward scheme and learning technique our experiment indicate that effective cooperative behavior with balanced division of workload emerge these result help u better understand how agent behave and interact with each other complex environment and how they coherently choose their individual action such that resulting joint action optimal
