bayesian network inverse inference manufacturing bayesian network inverse inference manufacturing bayesian network physic based simulation of manufacturing process used prediction of material property and defect number of industrial application however practising engineer often requires solution an inverse problem prediction of input desired outcome inverse problem is usually solved by constrained optimisation extensive simulation during optimisation is avoided through response surface constructed from simulation but design space is often so large that even with response surface optimisation might not possible moreover these problem typically ill posed so discriminative model such artificial neural network not work well this paper investigate application of conditional linear gaussian bayesian network address inverse problem with multi pas wire drawing process case study propose an approach systematically find solution and rank them according their likelihood
