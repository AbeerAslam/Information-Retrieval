finite gamma mixture model based discriminative learning framework mixture model gamma distribution generative learning svm object recognition 3d shape video event it is well known that classification task approached using either generative model or discriminative one while goal of generative approach is learn class conditional density main goal of discriminative technique is learn decision boundary directly without taking into account class conditional density classic supervised learning would usually represent given object an image instance by vector of d real valued feature and then select given generative or discriminative approach perform classification many application however object represented by set or bag of vector recent development machine learning along with powerful computational tool enabled researcher develop more sophisticated model handle such application using so called hybrid generative discriminative model main idea is based exploiting advantage of both family of model thus success of such an approach depends choice of an appropriate discriminative technique and suitable generative one goal of this paper is develop hybrid generative discriminative framework based support vector machine and gamma mixture particular focus generation of kernel when example image instance structured data i e described by set of vector modeled by gamma mixture experimental result real world challenging application namely 3d shape class recognition object categorization and video event analysis show effectiveness of proposed framework
