learning rank with only positive example information need modeling positive unlabeled learning transductive learning search by multiple example key successfully retrieve relevant document lie how user express their information need using keywords query however many user it is difficult them use keywords express their information need search by multiple example sbme promising method overcoming this problem allows user specify their information need set of relevant document rather than set of keywords this study propose transductive positive unlabeled learning tpu learning based framework document ranking framework consists of two step 1 identifying potential relevant document reduce searching space from entire data collection smaller dataset and 2 adopting tpu learning method re rank searching space by treating relevant document from user positive example p and document searching space unlabeled data u using map and p k evaluate two state of the art pu learning algorithm and rocchio classifier rc document ranking proposed framework with different size of p simulate user online search behavior then adopt idea of ensemble learning combine rc with two state of the art pu learning algorithm respectively experiment conducted two real datasets show that ensemble learning based method lead significant improvement performance
