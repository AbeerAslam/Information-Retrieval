power variance test nonstationarity complex valued signal stochastic process time series analysis nonstationary process bootstrap oceanography propose novel algorithm testing hypothesis of nonstationarity complex valued signal implementation us both bootstrap and fast fourier transform such that algorithm efficiently implemented o nlogn time where n is length of observed signal test procedure examines second order structure and contrast observed power variance i e variability of instantaneous variance over time with expected characteristic of stationary signal generated via bootstrap method our algorithmic procedure is capable of learning different type of nonstationarity such jump or strong sinusoidal component illustrate utility of our test and algorithm through application turbulent flow data from fluid dynamic
