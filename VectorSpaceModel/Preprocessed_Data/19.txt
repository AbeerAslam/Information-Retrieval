lacova tree based multi label classifier using label covariance splitting criterion multi label learning decision tree covariance matrix splitting criterion dealing with multiple label is supervised learning problem of increasing importance multi label classifier face challenge of exploiting correlation between label while existing work these correlation often modelled globally this paper use divide and conquer approach of decision tree which enables taking local decision about how best model label dependency resulting algorithm establishes tree based multi label classifier called lacova which dynamically interpolates between two well known baseline method binary relevance which assumes label independent and label powerset which learns joint label distribution key idea is splitting criterion based label covariance matrix that node which allows u choose between horizontal split branching feature and vertical split separating label empirical result 12 data set show strong performance of proposed method particularly data set with hundred of label
