activity recognition using graphical feature smart environment activity recognition graph representation activity recognition is important order facilitate elderly resident and their caregiver need this problem been widely investigated using different method including probabilistic and markovian approach focus of this paper is perform activity recognition more accuractely than existing approach represent motion sensor of smart environment graph and resident movement edge graph then graph based feature extracted and used input support vector machine these feature been combined with motion sensor based feature this method been compared with three other widely used approach naive bayes hidden markov model hmm and conditional random field crf three different datasets from three smart aparments case method based graphical feature outpeformed existing approach
