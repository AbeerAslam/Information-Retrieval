latent topic semantic indexing based automatic text summarization text summarization hierarchical bayesian model topic semantic indexing tsi one way anova automatic summarization difficult but pressing problem natural language processing aim shortening source document while retaining main information recent year more statistical machine learning method been applied automatic summarization this paper propose novel approach summarization based hierarchical bayesian model of topic semantic indexing tsi and extraction strategy of average log likelihood new method is tested brown corpus and it performance is analyzed by well designed blind experiment of one way anova human review experimental result show that tsi model is promising topic driven summarization
