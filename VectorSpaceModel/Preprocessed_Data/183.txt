adaptive modular approach online fault diagnosis of discrete event system adaptive approach fault diagnosis discrete event system diagnosabiliy this paper an adaptive modular approach is proposed achieve fault diagnosis of discrete event system desired normal behavior is represented by set of specification while fault of each predefined fault type considered execution of specific fault behavior violating specification inference of fault type of each fault is achieved by diagnosis module called diagnoser this approach considers that only normal behavior is known advance then it adapts diagnoser order integrate new specific fault behavior into it inference engine this adaptation allows increasing diagnosis capacity called diagnosability over time
