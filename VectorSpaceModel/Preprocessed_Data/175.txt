zero shot deep learning from semantic attribute semantics training estimation neural network taxonomy visualization support vector machine study problem of classifying image when training exemplar available some image class and therefore direct classification is not possible use instead semantic attribute if attribute of yet unseen class determined then class label may themselves decided based prior knowledge of class attribute relationship present several method determining attribute including an approach based attribute classifier and approach using b map and c mmse attribute estimator using image classifier known class preliminary test obtained using dataset comprised of imagenet image and human218 attribute yield encouraging performance
