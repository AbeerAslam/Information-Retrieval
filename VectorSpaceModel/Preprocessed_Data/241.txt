inferring hearing loss from learned speech kernel acoustic feature learning clustering tuning curve bandwidth equal loudness contour audiogram doe hearing impaired individual s speech reflect hearing loss and if it doe nature of hearing loss inferred from speech investigate these question least four hour of speech data were recorded from each of 37 adult individual both male and female belonging four class 7 normal and 30 severely to profoundly hearing impaired with high medium or low speech intelligibility acoustic kernel were learned each individual by capturing distribution of speech data point represented 20 m duration window these kernel were evaluated using set of neurophysiological metric namely distribution of characteristic frequency equal loudness contour bandwidth and q10 value of tuning curve our experimental result reveal that hearing impaired individual s speech doe reflect hearing loss provided loss of hearing considerably affected intelligibility of speech such individual lack of tuning any frequency range inferred from learned speech kernel
