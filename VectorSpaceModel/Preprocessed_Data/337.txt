toward parametric security analysis of machine learning based cyber forensic biometric system cyber forensic electroencephalogram machine learning security strength machine learning algorithm widely used cyber forensic biometric system analyze subject s truthfulness an interrogation an analytical method rather than experimental evaluate security strength of these system under potential cyber attack is essential this paper formalize theoretical method analyzing immunity of machine learning based cyber forensic system against evidence tampering attack apply our theory brain signal based forensic system that use neural network classify response from subject attack simulation is run validate our theoretical analysis result
