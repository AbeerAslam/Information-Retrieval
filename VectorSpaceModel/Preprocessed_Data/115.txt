statistical fault localization based importance sampling fault localization importance sampling this paper present novel probabilistic approach fault localization challenge based importance sampling iterative approach utilizes test result and execution profile estimate likelihood of suspiciousness of program statement over few iteration of probability update and sampling procedure directs it attention towards those statement that more likely faulty proposed approach is designed more sensitive failing test case comparison passing test case effectiveness of proposed stochastic approach is evaluated through two case study and result compared against other popular fault localization method
