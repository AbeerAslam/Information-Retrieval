reducing effect of detrimental instance filtering label noise instance weighting not instance data set equally beneficial inducing model of data some instance such outlier or noise detrimental however least initially instance data set generally considered equally machine learning algorithm many current approach handling noisy and detrimental instance make binary decision about whether an instance is detrimental or not this paper 1 extend this paradigm by weighting instance continuous scale and 2 present methodology measuring how detrimental an instance may inducing model of data call our method of identifying and weighting detrimental instance reduced detrimental instance learning rdil examine ridl set of 54 data set and 5 learning algorithm and compare ridl with other weighting and filtering approach rdil is especially useful learning algorithm where every instance affect classification boundary and training instance considered individually such multilayer perceptrons trained with backpropagation mlps our result also suggest that more accurate estimate of which instance detrimental significant positive impact handling them
