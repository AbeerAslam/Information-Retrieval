multimodal music and lyric fusion classifier artist identification classification multimodal sparse method audio human interact with each other using different communication modality including speech gesture and written document absence of one modality or presence of noisy modality other modality benefit precision of system hci system also benefit from these multimodal communication model different machine learning task provision of multiple modality is motivated by usability presence of noise one modality and non universality of single modality combining multimodal information introduces new challenge machine learning such designing fusion classifier this paper explore multimodal fusion of audio and lyric music artist identification compare our result with single modality artist classifier and introduce new direction designing fusion classifier
