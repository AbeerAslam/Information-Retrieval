robust kernel embedding of conditional and posterior distribution with application bayesian inference zero shot learning kernel method this paper proposes novel non parametric method robustly embed conditional and posterior distribution reproducing kernel hilbert space rkhs robust embedding is obtained by eigenvalue decomposition rkhs by retaining only leading eigenvectors noise data is methodically disregarded non parametric conditional and posterior distribution embedding obtained by our method applied wide range of bayesian inference problem this paper apply it heterogeneous face recognition and zero shot object recognition problem experimental validation show that our method produce better result than comparative algorithm
