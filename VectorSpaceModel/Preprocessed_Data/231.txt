modeling and simulation of community mobility model next generation wireless network using coloured petri net next generation wireless network topology mamagement routing and mobility management coloured petri net formal modeling wireless communication order obtain comprehensive research analysis of mobility management scheme and routing protocol wireless communication it is prerequisite that mobility model which simulation is based show realistic mobility pattern key problem with much of literature random model is that they produce unrealistic node movement trajectory and limitation viz border effect un sociological behavior and memory less mobility phenomenon this paper present novel community mobility model which provide foundation generating realistic mobility trace and mimic real world scenario analytical result validate it performance extensive simulation experiment conducted through steady state space analysis
