subject dependent ssvep identification using gmm training and adaptation brain computer interface steady state visual evoked potential gaussian mixture model adaptive learning maximum posteriori feature extraction partitioning canonical correlation analysis power spectral density analysis use of brain computer interface bci system intensive care unit icu facilitate communication demand bci system enable icu patient communicate using electrical activity of their brain this purpose designed and developed bci system comprised of an android tablet that allows patient look screen ask what they need using their electroencephalogram eeg recorded using wireless wearable bci however there two main challenge associated with bci application due insufficient screen refresh rate of mobile device flickering stimulus is imprecise hence introduce partition based feature extraction and fusion method using canonical correlation analysis cca and power spectral density analysis psda overcome this limitation also bci device require calibration stage order capture subject specific information which might particularly troublesome icu patient hypothesize that inducing subject related information model training and adaptation improves overall ssvep identification performance with minimal calibration requirement such propose three stage gaussian mixture model gmm based model training and subject adaptation 1 generate subject independent universal gmm model 2 generate subject dependent identification model using only few collected ssvep segment from each patient and 3 form vector out of subject dependent gmms and pas it support vector machine svm ssvep target frequency identification our experimental result 10 subject demonstrated that proposed framework yielded very efficient ssvep identification performance achieving 98 7 accuracy using our most accurate model
