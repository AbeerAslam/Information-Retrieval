online learning algorithm collective lda topic model online learning variational inference multi corpus data mining collective latent dirichlet allocation c lda is proposed an extension of lda simultaneously model multiple corpus from different domain order overcome bias of individual corpus however with large volume of document collection from various source it becomes challenging achieve fast convergence c lda high time complexity of c lda limit it application real world task luckily online learning shown promise speeding convergence of lda this paper propose explore online learning collective lda ovclda first develop an efficient variational inference algorithm collective lda and then extend it online learning framework perform experiment with various real world corpus experimental result shown that ovclda learn comparable topic with c lda and better than online lda and achieves comparable computational efficiency with online lda and is much more efficient than c lda
