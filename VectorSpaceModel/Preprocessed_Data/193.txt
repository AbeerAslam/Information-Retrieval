investigating new bootstrapping approach of bagging classifier account class imbalance bioinformatics datasets class imbalance bagging bootstrap approach bioinformatics one major challenge posed by bioinformatics datasets is class imbalance which occurs when one class many more instance than other class e it undesirable effect classification performance is compounded with fact that general class with fewer instance is class of interest bagging been utilized by practitioner field overcome challenge of class imbalance and improve classification performance our motivation this study is investigate whether change bootstrapping step of bagging classifier further improve their performance specifically these modification bootstrapping process take into account membership of class performed an extensive empirical study utilizing four bootstrap approach within bagging framework using three feature ranker along with four feature subset size and two base classifier across 15 imbalanced bioinformatics datasets three of these bootstrap approach were proposed and implemented by our research team this study our result show that new approach improve performance over classic bootstrap approach with balanced bagging having highest performance however observed increase performance not statistically significant recommend balanced bootstrap approach because it show most improvement term of frequency of having highest performance and it generates fully balanced bootstrap datasets that account class imbalance problem uniqueness of this paper is proposing and implementing three innovative bootstrapping approach examine effect of these bootstrapping process against classic one performance of bagging classifier domain of bioinformatics
