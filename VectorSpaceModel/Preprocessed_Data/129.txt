optimizing attack surface and configuration diversity using multi objective reinforcement learning multi objective reinforcement learning cybersecurity moving target defense minimizing attack surface of system and introducing diversity into system two effective way improve system security however determining how include diversity system without increasing attack surface more than necessary is difficult problem requiring knowledge about system characteristic operating environment and available permutation that is generally not available prior system deployment propose viewing system s component interface and communication channel set of state and action that analyzed using sequential decision making process and using multi objective reinforcement learning algorithm learn set of policy that minimize system s attack surface and execute those policy obtain configuration diversity while system is operating describe methodology designing system such that it component and behavior translated into multi objective markov decision process demonstrate use of multi objective reinforcement learning learn set of optimal policy using three different multi objective reinforcement learning algorithm context of an online file sharing application and show that our multi objective temporal difference afterstate algorithm outperforms alternative example problem
