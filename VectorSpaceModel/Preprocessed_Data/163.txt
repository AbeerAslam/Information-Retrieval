bilevel parameter tuning strategy of partially connected anns optimization neuron tuning topology training time series analysis network topology partially connected ann with evolvable topology pannet is non fully connected recurrent neural network with proper number of context node structure of network along with connection weight determined through evolutionary process of customized genetic algorithm this paper develop an evolutionary bilevel optimization procedure tuning hyper parameter of pannet upper level an evolutionary algorithm optimizes hyper parameter while customized genetic algorithm is training pannet lower level optimization since executing lower level optimization each candidate hyper parameter requires high computational cost fitness function approximation is performed using regression model based random forest method proposed procedure provides more flexibility choosing hyper parameter and generate smaller network with more accuracy prediction
