multilabel classification with weighted label using learning classifier system learning classifier system multi label classification uncertain label evolutionary based learning this work michigan style strength based learning classifier system which is rule based supervised learning algorithm is extended handle multi label classification task moreover it is assumed that class membership training data is partially known and uncertainty is represented by confidence value that reflects probability of each label being true necessary parameter introduced and learning classifier modified learn simultaneously confidence level and multi label training data additionally quantify classifier performance novel loss measure is introduced that generalizes well known hamming loss criterion take into account classification error and confidence estimation error simultaneously algorithm is tested one real world data and two synthetic data set result show ability of model learning multi class and multi label data with low confidence estimation error
