supervised machine learning based surface inspection by synthetizing artificial defect inspection surface image image synthetization artificial defect supervised machine learning convolutional neural net deep learning preparation of labeled training data supervised machine learning method involves lot of effort regarding surface inspection task this endeavor is often not economically reasonable this paper an artificial defect synthetization algorithm based multistep stochastic process is proposed it add defect fault free surface image which used supervised machine learning by this mean deep convolutional neural network been trained achieving detection rate of 94 of occurring real defect presented test surface
