switch and restart algorithm with exponential restart strategy objective selection and it runtime analysis runtime analysis objective selection algorithm selection online selection ea rl there exist optimization problem with target objective which is optimized and several extra objective which may or may not helpful optimization process this paper considers case when it is possible find an optimum of target objective by optimizing either target objective or single extra objective an algorithm is presented that us single instance of an underlying single objective optimization algorithm optimize different objective different iteration and restarts optimization algorithm between optimizing different objective this algorithm expected running time of most 4 k min_o t_o until an optimum of target objective is found where t_o is expected running time of underlying optimization algorithm find an optimum of target objective by optimizing objective o an impact of not using restarts between iteration is also discussed
