scalable learning of entity and predicate embeddings knowledge graph completion representation learning semantic web link prediction knowledge graph knowledge graph kg widely used formalism representing knowledge web of data focus problem of link prediction i e predicting missing link large knowledge graph so discover new fact about world representation learning model that embed entity and relation type continuous vector space recently were used achieve new state of the art link prediction result limiting factor these model is that process of learning optimal embedding vector really time consuming and might even require day of computation large kg this work propose principled method sensibly reducing learning time while converging more accurate link prediction model furthermore employ proposed method training and evaluating set of novel and scalable model our extensive evaluation show significant improvement over state of the art link prediction method several datasets
