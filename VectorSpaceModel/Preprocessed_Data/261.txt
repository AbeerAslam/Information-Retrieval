machine learning plant disease incidence and severity measurement from leaf image machine learning computer vision image based diagnosis feature selection many field superior gain been obtained by leveraging computational power of machine learning technique solve expert task this paper present an application of machine learning agriculture solving particular problem of diagnosis of crop disease based plant image taken with smartphone two piece of information important here disease incidence and disease severity present classification system that train 5 class classification system determine state of disease of plant 5 class represent health class and 4 disease class further extend classification system classify different severity level any of 4 disease severity level assigned class 1 5 1 being healthy plant 5 being severely diseased plant present way of extracting different feature from leaf image and show how different extraction method result different performance of classifier finally present smartphone based system that us classification model learnt real time prediction of state of health of farmer garden this work by farmer uploading an image of plant garden and obtaining disease score from remote server
