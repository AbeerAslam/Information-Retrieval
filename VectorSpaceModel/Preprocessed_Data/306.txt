applying meta heuristic prediction algorithm modeling power density wind power plant meta heuristic prediction algorithm power density wind power plant this paper robust artificial intelligence ai algorithm is applied overcome challenge power density prediction especially installation process of wind power plant this algorithm also explores relationship between meteorological parameter and power density importance degree of parameter power density is converted numerical weighting value independently from each other thus effect of wind speed wind direction temperature damp pressure power density could modelled besides experimental study show that prediction accuracy and stability of applied method superior than traditional ai based technique
