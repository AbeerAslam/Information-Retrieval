evaluating real time anomaly detection algorithm numenta anomaly benchmark anomaly detection time series data benchmark streaming data much of world s data is streaming time series data where anomaly give significant information critical situation example abound domain such finance it security medical and energy yet detecting anomaly streaming data is difficult task requiring detector process data real time not batch and learn while simultaneously making prediction there benchmark adequately test and score efficacy of real time anomaly detector here propose numenta anomaly benchmark nab which attempt provide controlled and repeatable environment of open source tool test and measure anomaly detection algorithm streaming data perfect detector would detect anomaly soon possible trigger false alarm work with real world time series data across variety of domain and automatically adapt changing statistic rewarding these characteristic is formalized nab using scoring algorithm designed streaming data nab evaluates detector benchmark dataset with labeled real world time series data present these component and give result and analysis several open source commercially used algorithm goal nab is provide standard open source framework with which research community compare and evaluate different algorithm detecting anomaly streaming data
