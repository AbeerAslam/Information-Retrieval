nmf based label space factorization multi label classification multi label classification non negative matrix factorization feature aware multi label classification is learning task which each data sample belong more than one class until now some method that based reducing dimensionality of label space been proposed however these method not used specific property of label space this purpose this paper intend find hidden space which both input feature vector and label vector embedded propose modified non negative matrix factorization nmf method that is suitable decomposing label matrix and finding proper hidden space by feature aware approach consider that label matrix is binary and also this matrix some deserving label an instance may not called missing label conduct several experiment and show superiority of our proposed method state of the art multi label classification method
