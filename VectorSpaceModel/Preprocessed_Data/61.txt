protein conformation motion modeling using sep cma e mass transfer cma e protein conformation conformation motion problem of protein conformation motion modeling is an open problem structural computational biology it is difficult solve it using method of molecular dynamic or quantum physic because these method deal with time interval of nanosecond or microsecond while conformation motion take time of millisecond order addition these method not take external force into consideration cope with these problem numerous approximated and coarse grained method developed which use idea from geometry and motion planning we present new coarse grained method of modeling protein motion between two given conformation method is based optimization of cost function similar one monge kantorovich mass transfer problem optimization is performed using sep cma e which make running time of an iteration linear number of amino acid protein proposed method is compared with some of existing method several molecule it is shown that result of proposed method more accurate than of other method
