self configuring and evolving fuzzy image thresholding evolving fuzzy system image segmentation thresholding medical image analysis every segmentation algorithm parameter that need adjusted order achieve good result evolving fuzzy system adjustment of segmentation parameter been proposed recently evolving fuzzy image segmentation efis 1 however similar any other algorithm efis too suffers from few limitation when used practice major drawback efis depends detection of object of interest feature calculation task that is highly application dependent this paper new version of efis is proposed overcome these limitation new efis called self configuring efis sc efis us available training data auto configure parameter that fixed efis well proposed scefis relies feature selection process that doe not require detection of region of interest roi
