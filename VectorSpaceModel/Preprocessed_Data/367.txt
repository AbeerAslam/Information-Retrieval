online structure search sum product network sum product network exact inference online learning variety of algorithm exist learning both structure and parameter of sum product network spns class of probabilistic model which exact inference done quickly vast majority of them batch learner including recently proposed algorithm searchspn however searchspn property that make it particularly suited adaptation online setting this paper introduce onlinesearchspn algorithm which doe just that compare it two general method that build online learner from batch learner one learns poor model quickly and other learns good model slowly our experiment show that onlinesearchspn achieves best of both method test likelihood value of model it learns good slow learner while training time needed learn model much closer fast learner
