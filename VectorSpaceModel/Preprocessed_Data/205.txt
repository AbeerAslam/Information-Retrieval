incremental learning decorrelated approximators approximation algorithm algorithm design and analysis silicon decorrelation reliability learning system mathematical model general designing an incremental learning system particular task least consists of choosing an appropriate approximation structure and learning algorithm common linear parameter lip approximation structure example polynomial radial basis function or grid based lookup table typical learning algorithm accompanying them example passive aggressive pa or recursive least square rls usually these two choice not independent not every learning algorithm is able handle any approximation structure well here present formalism that allows designer treat these two design aspect independently from each other by decorrelating basis function of approximator form new set of basis function that handled by any learning algorithm develop design guideline order make our approach an easy use tool and support designer making learning progress reliable design time further look property of our approach an extension lip approximators and investigate it implication behavior of incremental learning system using artificial benchmark and real world data set regression task
