limitation of convolutional neural network recognizing negative image convolutional neural network negative image convolutional neural network cnns achieved state of the art performance variety of computer vision task particularly visual classification problem where new algorithm reported achieve or even surpass human performance this paper examine whether cnns capable of learning semantics of training data this end evaluate cnns negative image since they share same structure and semantics regular image and human classify them correctly our experimental result indicate that when training regular image and testing negative image model accuracy is significantly lower than when it is tested regular image this lead u conjecture that current training method not effectively train model generalize concept then introduce notion of semantic adversarial example transformed input that semantically represent same object but model doe not classify them correctly and present negative image one class of such input
