hybrid scheme fault diagnosis with partially labeled set of observation fault diagnosis semi supervised learning bearing defect dimensionality reduction induction motor machine learning technique widely used diagnosing fault guarantee safe and reliable operation of system among various technique semi supervised learning help diagnosing faulty state and decision making partially labeled data where only few number of labeled observation along with large number of unlabeled observation collected from process thus it is crucial conduct critical study use of semi supervised technique both dimensionality reduction and fault classification this work three state of the art semi supervised dimensionality reduction technique used produce informative feature semi supervised fault classifier this study aim achieve best pair of semisupervised dimensionality reduction and classification technique that integrated into diagnostic scheme decision making under partially labeled set of observation
