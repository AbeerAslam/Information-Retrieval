sequential pattern based temporal contour representation content based multimedia timeline analysis sequential pattern multimedia structure analysis multimedia signal processing contour representation temporal contour shape closely linked narrative structure of multimedia content and provide important reference point content based multimedia timeline analysis this paper multimedia timeline is extracted from content time varying video and audio signal feature temporal contour representation is implemented based sequential pattern discovery algorithm modeling variation contour of multimedia feature proposed contour representation extract repetitive temporal pattern from hierarchy of time resolution or from synchronized video audio feature dimension statistically significant contour component depicting dominant timeline shape utilized structural or analytical representation of timeline modeling performance of this proposed temporal modeling framework is demonstrated through empirical validation and subjective evaluation
