distributed conformal anomaly detection conformal prediction anomaly detection distributed computing validity conformal approach anomaly detection wa recently developed reliable framework of classifying example into normal and abnormal group based training data set containing only normal example it validity property is that normal example generated by same distribution example from training set is classified anomaly with probability bounded from above by pre selected significance level parallel processing of big data may require split of training set into several source also assume that collection of data two or more source might done parallel and data distribution may differ these source contribution of this work conformal anomaly detection is studying way of keeping conformal validity when training set is obtained from heterogeneous differently distributed source
