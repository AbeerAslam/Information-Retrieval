dimensionality reduction statistical learning statistical learning dimensionality reduction manifold learning tangent bundle manifold learning unsupervised learning many statistical learning task deal with data which presented high dimensional space and curse of dimensionality phenomenon is often an obstacle use of many method solving these task avoid these phenomenon various dimensionality reduction algorithm used first key step solution of these task algorithm transform original high dimensional data into their lower dimensional representation such way that initial task may reduced corresponding task constructed lower dimensional representation of original dataset dimensionality reduction problem different formulation depending initial statistical learning task new geometrically motivated algorithm that solves various dimensionality reduction problem is presented
