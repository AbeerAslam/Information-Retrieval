on line signature verification using symbolic aggregate approximation sax and sequential minimal optimization smo signature discretize unordered classification training bag of pattern signature single most widely used method of identifying an individual but they carry with them an alarmingly significant amount of vulnerability implying need an effective and robust method of precisely identifying an individual signature signature of an individual is visually acquired by using pen based tracking system 1 2 this paper considers possibility of discretizing visually acquired signature represent them an unordered collection of word and then use sequential mining optimization smo training support vector machine svm classify signature either legitimate or forged discretizing of signature is done by using symbolic aggregate approximation sax 4 sax reduces dimension of signature and produce list of sax word which then represented bag of pattern model classification purpose 5 data set consisted of more than 3960 signature of 106 subject distributed across two set result obtained provided good classification accuracy and additionally provided an insight into unique pattern of each subject signature
