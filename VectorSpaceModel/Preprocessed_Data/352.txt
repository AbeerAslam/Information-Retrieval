deep learning based car damage classification automobile training feature extraction machine learning support vector machine glass image based vehicle insurance processing is an important area with large scope automation this paper consider problem of car damage classification where some of category fine granular explore deep learning based technique this purpose initially try directly training cnn however due small set of labeled data it doe not work well then explore effect of domain specific pre training followed by fine tuning finally experiment with transfer learning and ensemble learning experimental result show that transfer learning work better than domain specific fine tuning achieve accuracy of 89 5 with combination of transfer and ensemble learning
