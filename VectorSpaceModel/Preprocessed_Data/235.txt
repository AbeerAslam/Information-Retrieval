class decomposition using k mean and hierarchical clustering class decomposition classification clustering machine learning this paper present clustering based class decomposition approach improve performance of classifier class decomposition work by dividing each class into cluster and by relabeling instance contained by each cluster with new class several case study used class decomposition combined with linear classifier while there is an essential improvement classification accuracy because of class decomposition most effective clustering algorithm is not obvious aim of this work is investigate effect of two clustering algorithm k mean and hierarchical class decomposition this work study class decomposition when combined with naive bayes classifier using four real world datasets experimental result show an improvement classification accuracy most of datasets when class decomposition using both k mean and hierarchical clustering is performed result also show that class decomposition is not suitable datasets
