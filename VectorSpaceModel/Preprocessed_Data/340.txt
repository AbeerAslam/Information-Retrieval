an oblivious routing based power flow calculation method loss minimization of smart power network theoretical perspective large scale network flow loss minimization oblivious routing scheme power system power loss minimization play an important role appropriate operation of power network line power loss occurs when power is transmitted through line of network due permittivity of line medium transmission loss may increase dispatch cost of of obtained power flow based market contract hence independent system operator should use loss minimization method facilitate implementation of contracted power transaction loss minimization also will improve security and stability of power network this paper present novel loss minimization scheme based oblivious network design referred oblivious routing based power flow method method is built bottom up oblivious network routing scheme which offer multiple path from several source generation unit specific destination electric load demand although there is limited information regarding other line flow and current status of network routing scheme mathematically guarantee that power flow solution is an approximation of optimal solution with specific competitiveness ratio fact our main focus is power flow calculation while optimizing power loss compared with recently developed power flow method our approach doe not depend network topology and it performance both radial and non radial network is accurate hence it is suitable use propose approach large scale loss minimization while determining power flow this paper mainly focus theoretical aspect of proposed method our method is based novel concept from computer science discipline provide sufficient explanation about preliminary of oblivious routing scheme
