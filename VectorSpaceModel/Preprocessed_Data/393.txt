comparing transfer learning and traditional learning under domain class imbalance transfer learning domain class imbalance traditional machine learning transfer learning is subclass of machine learning which us training data source drawn from different domain than that of testing data target transfer learning environment is characterized by unavailability of labeled data from target domain due data being rare or too expensive obtain however there exists abundant labeled data from different but similar domain these two domain likely different distribution characteristic transfer learning algorithm attempt align distribution characteristic of source and target domain create high performance classifier this paper provides comparative performance analysis between stateof the art transfer learning algorithm and traditional machine learning algorithm under domain class imbalance condition domain class imbalance condition is characterized by source and target domain having different class probability which create marginal distribution difference between source and target data statistical analysis is provided show significance of result
