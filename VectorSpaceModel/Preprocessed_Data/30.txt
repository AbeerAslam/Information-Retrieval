one shot periodic activity recognition using convolutional neural network human activity recognition convolutional neural network cnn activity capture vital fact semantic analysis of human behavior this paper propose method recognizing human activity based periodic action from single instance using convolutional neural network cnn height of foot above ground is considered feature discriminate human locomotion activity periodic nature of action these activity is exploited generate training case from single instance using sliding window also capability of convolutional neural network learn local visual pattern is exploited human activity recognition experiment carnegie mellon university cmu mocap dataset demonstrate effectiveness of proposed approach
