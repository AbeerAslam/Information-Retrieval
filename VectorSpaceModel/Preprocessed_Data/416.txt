multistep ahead streamflow and reservoir level prediction using anns production planning hydroelectric station prediction anns hydroelectric reservoir level streamflow this work methodology estimate reservoir level hydroelectric dam based predicted streamflow and desired active power is presented streamflow is predicted using two multistep ahead prediction method close loop prediction clp and open loop prediction olp streamflow predictor and dam model based artificial neural network anns further analysis of historical streamflow data demonstrated presence of three climatic season and allowed set better configuration of anns topology and horizon prediction system wa tested hydroelectric power plant ecuador particular comparison between result obtained from different combination of streamflow predictor and dam model wa performed concerning success percentage of prediction finally dam model revealed good accuracy reservoir level prediction when combined with most promising streamflow predictor implemented with clp method summer season
