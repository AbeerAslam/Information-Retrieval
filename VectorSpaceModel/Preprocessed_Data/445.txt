advanced echmm based machine learning tool complex big data application workload characterization hmm cepstral coefficient present novel approach accurate characterization of workload which is relevant context of complex big data application workload generally described with statistical model and based analysis of resource request measurement of running program this paper propose consider sequence of virtual memory reference generated from program during it execution temporal series and use spectral analysis principle process sequence however sequence is time varying so employed processing approach based ergodic continuous hidden markov model echmms which extend conventional stationary spectral analysis approach analysis of time varying sequence this work describe two application of proposed approach on line classification of running process and generation of synthetic trace of given workload first step wa show that echmms accurately describe virtual memory sequence this goal different echmm wa trained each sequence and related run time average process classification accuracy evaluated using trace driven simulation over wide range of trace of spec2000 wa about 82 then single echmm wa trained using sequence obtained from given running application again classification accuracy been evaluated using same trace and it resulted about 76 regard synthetic trace generation single echmm characterizing given application been used stochastic generator produce benchmark spanning large application space
