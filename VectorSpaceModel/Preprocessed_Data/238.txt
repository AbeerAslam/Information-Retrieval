iterative grammar based framework discovering variable length time series motif grammar time series analysis approximation algorithm noise reduction compression algorithm algorithm design and analysis data mining recent year finding repetitive similar pattern time series become popular problem these pattern called time series motif recent study show that using grammar compression algorithm find repeating pattern from symbolized time series hold promise discovering approximate motif with variable length however grammar compression algorithm traditionally designed string compression therefore existing work grammar induction not fully utilized much available information that used enhance performance of algorithm this work an iterative framework based grammar induction is proposed each iteration revision operator called noise reduction operator is applied revise symbolized time series string based rule returned from base grammar induction algorithm our experiment show that proposed work find motif of same quality with much faster running time compared state of the art variable length exact motif discovery algorithm real world time series data
