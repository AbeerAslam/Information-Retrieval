decoding epileptogenesis reduced state space epilepsy epileptogenesis biomarker nonlinear dynamic hidden markov model describe here recent result of multidisciplinary effort design biomarker that actively and continuously decode progressive change neuronal organization leading epilepsy process known epileptogenesis using an animal model of acquired epilepsy chronically record hippocampal evoked potential elicited by an auditory stimulus using set of reduced coordinate our algorithm identify universal smooth low dimensional configuration of auditory evoked potential that correspond distinct stage of epileptogenesis use hidden markov model learn dynamic of evoked potential it evolves along these smooth low dimensional subset provide experimental evidence that biomarker is able exploit subtle change evoked potential reliably decode stage of epileptogenesis and predict whether an animal will eventually recover from injury or develop spontaneous seizure
