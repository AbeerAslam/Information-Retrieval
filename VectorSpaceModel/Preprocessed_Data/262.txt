exposing inpainting forgery jpeg image under recompression attack inpainting combination forgery jpeg recompression image forgery detection inpainting originally designed computer vision reconstruct lost or deteriorated part of image and video been used image tampering including region filling and object removal alter truth while several type of tampering including copy move and seam carving forgery now successfully exposed image forensics there been very little study tackle inpainting forgery jpeg image detection of which is extremely challenging due post recompression attack performed cover or compromise original inpainting trace date there is effective way detect inpainting image forgery under combined recompression attack fill such gap image forensics and reveal inpainting forgery from post recompression attack jpeg image propose this paper an approach that begin with large feature mining discrete transform domain ensemble learning is then applied deal with high feature dimensionality and prevent overfitting that generally happens some regular classifier under high feature dimension our study show proposed approach effectively expose inpainting forgery under post recompression attack especially it noticeably improves detection accuracy while recompression quality is lower than original jpeg image quality and thus bridge gap image forgery detection
