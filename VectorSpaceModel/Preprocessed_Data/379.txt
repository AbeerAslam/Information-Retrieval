uoi nmf cluster robust nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm improved part based decomposition and reconstruction of noisy data nonnegative matrix factorization interpretable machine learning union of intersection part based decomposition neuroscience with ever growing collection of large volume of scientific data development of interpretable machine learning tool analyze such data is becoming more important however robust interpretable machine learning tool lacking threatening extraction of scientific insight and discovery nonnegative matrix factorization nmf algorithm decompose an m n nonnegative data matrix into k n basis matrix h and an m k weight matrix w such that wh where k is desired rank this paper present novel two stage algorithm uoi nmf cluster nmf which is based three innovation i completely separate base learning from weight estimation ii learn base by clustering nmf result across bootstrap resamples of data and iii use recently introduced union of intersection uoi framework estimate ultra sparse weight that maximize data reconstruction accuracy deploy our algorithm various synthetic and scientific data illustrate it performance with focus neuroscience data compared other nmf algorithm uoi nmf cluster yield more accurate part based decomposition of noisy data b sparse and accurate weight matrix and c high accuracy reconstruction of de noised data together these improvement enhance performance and interpretability of nmf application noisy data and suggest similar approach may benefit other matrix decomposition algorithm
