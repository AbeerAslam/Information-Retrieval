integrated framework improving large scale hierarchical classification hierarchical classification inconsistency logistic regression scalability orphan node prediction hierarchical classification hc approach leverage hierarchical structure during training and testing of model which help improvement of classification performance and prediction efficiency however their performance improvement comparison flat approach may poor if hierarchy used training contains i inconsistent hierarchical relationship such parent child or sibling and ii less cohesive or overlapping class moreover dynamic change data characteristic over time requires new class orphan node identified improve generalization performance of learned model addition also need deal with imbalance data large scale problem where large number of class few example training posing statistical challenge this paper propose an integrated framework address aforementioned issue improving large scale hc our experimental evaluation various image and text datasets show improved performance with our proposed framework
