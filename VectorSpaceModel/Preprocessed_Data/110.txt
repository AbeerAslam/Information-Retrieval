learning multi valued biological model with delayed influence from time series observation dynamical system multi valued model boolean network delay markov k learning from interpretation transition inductive logic programming delayed effect important modeling biological system and timed boolean network been proposed such framework yet it is not an easy task design such boolean model with delay precisely recently an attempt learn timed boolean network been made ribeiro et al 2015 framework of learning state transition rule from time series data however this approach still two limitation 1 maximum delay given input algorithm 2 possible value of each state is assumed boolean i e twovalued this paper extend previous learning mechanism overcome these limitation propose an algorithm learn multi valued biological model with delayed influence by automatically tuning delay delay is determined so minimally explain necessary influence merit of our approach is then verified benchmark coming from dream4 challenge
