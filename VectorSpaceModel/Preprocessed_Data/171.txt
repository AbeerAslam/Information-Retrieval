iclass combining multiple multi label classification with expert knowledge ensemble expert knowledge knowledge base machine learning multi label classifier supervised learning survey datasets roper center is one of largest public opinion data archive world it collect data set of polled survey question from numerous medium outlet and organization volume of data introduces search complexity over survey question and pose challenge when analyzing search trend roper center question level retrieval application used human metadata expert assign topic content this been insufficient reach required level of consistency and provides an inadequate base creating an advanced search experience objective of this work is combine human expert team knowledge of nature of survey question and concept and topic these question express with ability of multi label classifier learn this knowledge and apply it an automated fast and accurate classification mechanism this approach cut down question analysis and tagging time significantly well provides enhanced consistency and scalability topic description same time creating an ensemble of machine learning classifier combined with expert knowledge is expected enhance search experience and provide much needed analytic capability survey question database our design use classification from several machine learning algorithm like svm and decision tree combined with expert knowledge form of handcrafted rule data analysis and result review consolidate different technique into multipath classifier with confidence point system that decides upon relevance of topic assigned survey question with nearly perfect accuracy
