bag of bag nested multi instance classification prostate cancer detection multi instance classification cancer detection computer aided detection cad computer aided detection cad algorithm been proposed auto detection of different type of cancer cad algorithm rely machine learning method classify region of interest image into cancerous and healthy region cancer screening foremost problem solve is whether patient cancer regardless of location of cancerous region organ this allows early detection of disease leading right course of action term of treatment taken machine learning this problem been formulated multi instance learning mil where bag of instance classified rather than individual instance this paper propose bag of bag bob nested mil algorithm where high level bag or parent bag each contains multiple smaller bag of instance applied proposed bob mil algorithm prostate cancer detection problem using magnetic resonance imaging data first detect which patient cancer and consequently detect which slice 3d volume imaging data of detected patient contain cancerous region experimental result obtained from imaging data of 30 patient with ground truth data based biopsy result show that proposed algorithm is not only capable of detecting prostate cancer patient level it is also able detect cancerous region slice level of imaging data with high accuracy
