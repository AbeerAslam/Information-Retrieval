tool machine with brain touchless wheel alignment with neural network training with noisy data wheel alignment 2 dim distance measure neural network kohonen self organizing network association map this document describes proof of concept new approach next generation wheel alignment system propose measure relevant angel with kohonen self organizing network from an image of heavy precision camera instead of projecting system clamped wheel this clear advantage that not need attach specially designed clamp which hold wheel with mirror scale or led that target system will shot photo from each wheel from well determined position and calculate relevant angel from it with kohonen self organizing neural network compare utility several distance measure retrieve best association map which determines necessary coordinate system is designed learning system that need certain amount of training training is designed that it surely converges after well determined number of run further optimize training using noisy data system is designed car manufacturer that need measure many similar car daily basis
