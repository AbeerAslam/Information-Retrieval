accuracy and robustness correlated neural network robustness measurement training computational modeling error analysis agriculture machine learning model vulnerable adversarial example formed by applying small carefully chosen perturbation input that cause unexpected classification error this paper perform experiment various adversarial example generation approach with multiple deep convolutional neural network including residual network best performing model imagenet large scale visual recognition challenge 2015 compare adversarial example generation technique with respect quality of produced image and measure robustness of tested machine learning model adversarial example finally conduct large scale experiment cross model adversarial portability find that adversarial example mostly transferable across similar network topology and demonstrate that better machine learning model less vulnerable adversarial example
