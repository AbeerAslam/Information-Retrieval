modelling of fuzzy logic controller of maximum power point tracker based artificial neural network grid connected pv system dc dc boost converter maximum power point tracker fuzzy logic controller artificial neural network back propagation algorithm hybrid neurone fuzzy grid connected photovoltaic system gcpv become more used system renewable energy several research been carried out improve efficiency and decrease of energy loss one of important component used increase efficiency is dc dc boost converter this paper new hybrid model is proposed control dc dc converter this new controller is built fuzzy logic controller flc and artificial neural network ann pathway taken build model is divided into three step first step is generate data based flc next step is choose an ann structure modeling flc and last step is test and validation of obtained model phase of building an ann is achieved by supervised learning based back propagation algorithm this algorithm is used train ann model by searching of optimal weight and threshold that been minimal root mean square error between flc output and ann model validation test wa performed with various irradiation value between both intelligent controller and classical p o algorithm simultaneously
