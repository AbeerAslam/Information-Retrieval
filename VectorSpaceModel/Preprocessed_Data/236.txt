an application of classification and class decomposition use case point estimation method effort prediction classification clustering use case point ucp estimation method describes process of computing software project size and productivity from use case diagram element these metric then used predict project effort early stage of software development main challenge with previous model that they were constructed based very limited number of observation and using limited productivity ratio this paper present new approach predict productivity from ucp environmental factor by applying classification with decomposition technique class decomposition provides number of advantage supervised learning algorithm through segmenting class into more homogenous class and therefore increase their diversity proposed model is constructed and validated over two datasets that relatively sufficient number of observation accuracy result promising and potential increase accuracy of early effort estimation
