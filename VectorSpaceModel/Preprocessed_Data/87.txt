incremental svd insight into wind generation vector matrix decomposition approximation method singular value decomposition wind speed this paper formulate problem of predicting wind generation one of streaming data analysis want understand if it is possible use weather data time window just before current time gain insight into how wind generation might behave time interval just after current time specifically use singular value decomposition of weather data and how that number of singular value and largest singular value used predict magnitude of change generation near future analysis us an incremental algorithm based sliding window reduced computational cost
