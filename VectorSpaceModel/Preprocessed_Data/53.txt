improving robustness of gaussian process based inferential control system using kernel principle component analysis control system process control kernel gaussian process principal component analysis robustness vector plausibility and robustness of an inferential control system entirely depend prediction accuracy of estimator used feedback element this paper is based previously proposed gaussian process inferential controller that employ gaussian process soft sensor an estimator paper enhances robustness and reliability of control system particularly during sensor input failure contribution of paper is i alleviating affect of failure prediction accuracy of feedback element soft sensor and thus improving robustness of overall control system ii hybridising kernel principal component analysis with gaussian process inferential control system achieve this robustness during process operating condition paper empirically show effectiveness and plausibility of processed hybrid system simulated chemical reactor process
