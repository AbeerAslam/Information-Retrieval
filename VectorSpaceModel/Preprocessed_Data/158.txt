prediction of sunspot number using minimum error entropy cost based kernel adaptive filter kernel method error entropy information theoretic learning several algorithm adaptive filtering based minimization of mean squared error mse cost function however mse is just second order statistic and hence doe not capture entire information about probability distribution of error system an information theoretic alternative is using minimum error entropy mee cost function adaptive algorithm based this criterion been developed and shown superior compared mse counterpart this work kernel version of some of these method designed and tested predicting annual sunspot number sunspot number is number of visibly darker region solar surface and been shown instrumental modeling space weather state of ionosphere climatic anomaly and even global warming comparative performance study of various linear and kernel algorithm trained with both mee and mse criterion predicting such chaotic non linear time series is presented this paper experimental result clearly show advantage of mee based kernel design which is per expectation given that it advantage of being non linear along with being able derive maximum information from error distribution
