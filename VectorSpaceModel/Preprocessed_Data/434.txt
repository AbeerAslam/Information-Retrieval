exploring impact of clone refactoring test code size object oriented software object oriented software clone refactoring source code attribute test code size metric linear regression machine learning algorithm this paper aim exploring impact of clone refactoring test code size term of number of operation object oriented software investigated three research question 1 impact of clone refactoring three important source code attribute coupling complexity and size that related unit testability of class 2 impact of clone refactoring test code size and 3 variation after clone refactoring source code attribute that most important impact test code size used linear regression and three popular machine learning technique i e k nearest neighbor nave bayes and random forest develop predictive and explanatory model used data collected from an open source java software system ant that been refactored using clone refactoring technique analysis indicate that there is strong and positive relationship between clone refactoring and reduction of test code size result show that 1 source code attribute of refactored class been significantly improved 2 test code size of refactored class been significantly reduced and 3 variation of test code size more influenced by variation of complexity and size of refactored class compared coupling
