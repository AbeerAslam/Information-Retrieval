recognition of acoustic event using masked conditional neural network restricted boltzmann machine rbm conditional restricted boltzmann machine crbm conditional neural network clnn masked conditional neural network mclnn deep neural network environmental sound recognition esr automatic feature extraction using neural network accomplished remarkable success image but sound recognition these model usually modified fit nature of multi dimensional temporal representation of audio signal spectrogram this may not efficiently harness time frequency representation of signal conditional neural network clnn take into consideration interrelation between temporal frame and masked conditional neural network mclnn extends upon clnn by forcing systematic sparseness over network s weight using binary mask masking allows network learn about frequency band rather than bin mimicking filterbank used signal transformation such mfcc additionally mask is designed consider various combination of feature which automates feature hand crafting process applied mclnn environmental sound recognition problem using urbansound8k yornoise esc 10 and esc 50 datasets mclnn achieved competitive performance compared state of the art convolutional neural network and hand crafted attempt
