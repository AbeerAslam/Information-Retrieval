railway incident ranking with machine learning incident ranking railway incident xgboost modern railway network include thousand of failure registration device and prompt response detected failure is critical normal network operation however large share of produced alert may formed by false alarm associated with maintenance or faulty diagnostics thus hindering processing of actual failure it is therefore very desirable perform fast automated intelligent ranking of incident before they analyzed by human operator this paper describe machine learning based incident ranking model that developed and deployed moscow railway network large network with 500 station model estimate probability of failure using multiple feature of incident hand model wa constructed using xgboost library and database of 5 million historical incident model show high accuracy auc 0 901 deployment environment
