android malware detection building useful representation malware classification logistic regression random projection android dimensionality reduction feature selection problem of proactively detecting android malware proven challenging one challenge stem from variety of issue but recent literature shown that this task is hard solve with high accuracy when only restricted set of feature like permission or similar fixed set of feature used opposite approach of including available feature is also problematic it cause feature space grow beyond reasonable size this paper focus finding an efficient way select representative feature space preserving it discriminative power unseen data go beyond traditional approach like principal component analysis which is too heavy large scale problem with million of feature particular show that many feature group that extracted from android application package like feature extracted from manifest file or string extracted from dalvik executable dex should filtered and used classification separately our proposed dimensionality reduction scheme is applied each group separately and consists of raw string preprocessing feature selection via log odds and finally applying random projection with size of feature space growing exponentially function of training set s size our approach drastically decrease size of feature space of several order of magnitude this turn allows accurate classification become possible real world scenario after reducing dimensionality use feature group light weight ensemble of logistic classifier evaluated proposed classification scheme real malware data provided by antivirus vendor and achieved state of the art 88 24 true positive and reasonably low 0 04 false positive rate with significantly compressed feature space balanced test set of 10 000 sample
