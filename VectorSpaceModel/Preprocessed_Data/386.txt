stacking method hierarchical classification hierarchical classification bioinformatics stacking hierarchical classification hc consists of classification problem whose class structured hierarchical fashion many problem addressed by hc special decent amount of work dealt with bioinformatics related problem such protein function prediction pfp and transposable element te classification both of them still challenging task hc due noisy and imbalanced nature of datasets countermeasure stacking is an ensemble method capable of generalizing knowledge from many classifier this work propose three stacking method hc and evaluate it performance pfp and te datasets our result show that when compared regular stacking and state of art method from literature our method able obtain superior or competitive performance
