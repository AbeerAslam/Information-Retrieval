source aware partitioning robust cross validation machine learning cross validation source aware robust learning one of most critical component of engineering machine learning algorithm live application is robust performance assessment prior it implementation cross validation is used forecast specific algorithm s classification or prediction accuracy new input data given finite dataset training and testing algorithm two most well known cross validation technique random subsampling rss and k fold used generalize assessment result of machine learning algorithm non exhaustive random manner this work first show that an inertia based activity recognition problem where data is collected from different user of wrist worn wireless accelerometer random partitioning of data regardless of cross validation technique result statistically similar average accuracy standard feed forward neural network classifier propose novel source aware partitioning technique where sample from specific user completely left out of training validation set rotation average error proposed cross validation method is significantly higher with lower standard variation which is major indicator of cross validation robustness approximately 30 increase average error rate implies that source aware cross validation could better indication of live algorithm performance where test data statistic would significantly different than training data due source or user sensitive nature of process data
