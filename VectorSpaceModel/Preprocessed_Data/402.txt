adventure game with neural network controlled non playing character neural network genetic algorithm web based game neuroevolution this paper present way evolve non playing character by controlling it through neural network then using genetic algorithm alter weight previous neural network data provides population from which select individual and simulated result allow relative ranking that use fitness function treating selected set of neural network weight binary sequence program us cross over and mutation create new set of weight which subsequently evaluated through this process find that program creates better set of neural network weight and that relative ranking allow computer controlled character range of difficulty level implement this experiment part of game
