clustering distributed short time series with dense pattern time series clustering short time series distributed data clustering clustering of gene with similar temporal profile is an important task gene expression data analysis current approach clustering of sparse gene expression data with temporal information suffer from their least quadratic complexity number of cluster number of gene or both and not distributed this paper present first distributed and density based approach short time series clustering called dtscluster which is suitable gene expression data dtscluster identifies dense pattern distributed datasets and us them generate time series cluster comparative experimental result revealed that dtscluster is scalable dataset size with linear complexity time and space and outperforms other representative approach term of cluster validation with silhouette index well distributed scenario also open opportunity collaborative data mining between different gene expression data holder
