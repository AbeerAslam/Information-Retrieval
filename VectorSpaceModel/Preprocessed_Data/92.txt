iterative hard thresholding keyword extraction from large text corpus text analysis information retrieval iterative method statistical analysis better understand and analyze text corpus such news it is often useful extract keywords that meaningfully associated with given topic corpus of document labeled by their topic used approach this learning problem consider this problem through lens of statistical text analysis using bag of word frequency feature sparse linear model demonstrate through numerical experiment that iterative hard thresholding iht is practical and effective algorithm keyword extraction from large text corpus fact our implementation of iht quickly analyze more than 800 000 document returning keywords comparable algorithm solving lasso problem formulation with significantly less computation time further generalize analysis of iht algorithm show that it is stable rank deficient matrix those arising from our bag of word model often
