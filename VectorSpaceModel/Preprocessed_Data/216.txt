identifying daily electric consumption pattern from smart meter data by mean of clustering algorithm fault diagnosis valve mathematical model sensor radio frequency discrete event system adaptation model this paper present clustering approach applied daily energy consumption curve of building our aim is identify reduced set of consumption pattern tertiary building during one year these pattern depend temperature throughout year well type of day working day work free day and school holiday two clustering approach used independently namely functional k mean algorithm that take into account functional aspect of data and expectation maximization algorithm based gaussian mixture model em gmm clustering result of two algorithm analyzed and compared this study represents first step towards development of prediction model energy consumption
