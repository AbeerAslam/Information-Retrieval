energy efficient eeg monitoring system wireless epileptic seizure detection eeg signal seizure detection missing random expectation maximization wireless eeg monitoring system been successfully used seizure detection outside clinical setting wireless eeg sensor node consume considerable amount of battery energy acquire encode and transmit data server side this paper introduce energy efficient monitoring system increase sensor battery lifetime specifically propose feature extraction method that is robust artifact and effectively select most discriminant feature relevant seizure second show how use missing random mar method reduce energy required sensor node data transmission without compromising seizure detection accuracy server side finally show how expectation maximization em method is used server side accurately substitute missing value performance of proposed scheme is compared those of state of the art method and is shown achieve less power consumption without compromising seizure detection accuracy
