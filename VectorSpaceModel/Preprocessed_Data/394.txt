robustspam inference from noisy longitudinal data and preservation of privacy robust temporal pattern noisy data privacy availability of complex temporal datasets social health and consumer context driven development of pattern mining technique that enable use of classical machine learning tool model building this work introduce robust temporal pattern mining framework finding predictive pattern complex timestamped multivariate and noisy data design an algorithm robustspam that enables mining of temporal pattern from data with noisy timestamps apply our algorithm social care data from local government body and investigate how efficiency and accuracy of method depends level of noise further explore trade off between loss of predictivity due perturbation of timestamps and risk of person re identification
