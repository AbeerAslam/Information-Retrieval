coordinate descent fuzzy twin support vector machine classification coordinate descent fuzzy active set shrinking high dimensional input tsvm svm this paper develop novel coordinate descent fuzzy twin svm cdftsvm classification proposed cdftsvm not only inherits advantage of twin svm but also lead rapid and robust classification result specifically our cdftsvm two distinguished advantage 1 an effective fuzzy membership function is produced removing noise incurred by contaminant input 2 coordinate descent strategy with shrinking by active set is used deal with computational complexity brought by high dimensional input addition series of simulation experiment conducted verify performance of cdftsvm which further support our previous claim
