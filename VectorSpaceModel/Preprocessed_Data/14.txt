feature selection effectively localizing faulty event gui application gui feature selection fault localization due complex causality of failure and special characteristic of test case fault gui graphic user interface application difficult localize this paper adapts feature selection algorithm localize gui related fault given program feature defined subsequence of event executed by employing statistical feature ranking technique event ranked by suspiciousness of event being responsible exhibit faulty behavior feature defined given source code implementing event handle underlying event then ranked suspiciousness order evaluation of proposed technique based some open source java project verified effectiveness of this feature selection based fault localization technique gui application
