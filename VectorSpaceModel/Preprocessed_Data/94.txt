automatic gender classification system from finger 2d 4d ratio and comparison of success with using different algorithm classification algorithm 2d 4d mass death automatic gender estimation index and ring finger ratio high rate of correctness of information determining identity of corps mass death such disaster aircraft high speed train or sea accident and fire where people damaged an extent that they not identified and method followed main element this study dataset wa formed by taking index finger ring finger height and age of 67 turkish men and 56 turkish woman dataset wa used identifying sex of person and thus information that could reveal identity of information wa obtained lad tree algorithm naive bayes algorithm knn algorithm and c4 5 algorithm were tried datasets c4 5 algorithm highest rate of success determining sex with rate of 93 therefore automatic sex classification wa made using c4 5 algorithm study revealed that 2d 4d ratio varies different sex and race moving from these study sex wa determined from ratio of index finger ring finger when compared with existing study literature different race it wa proved that race also determined it wa found that left hand provided higher success finger ratio use identifying sex compared right hand
