implementation of machine learning classifying hemiplegic gait disparity through use of force plate force plate hemiplegic gait logistic regression machine learning gait analysis synergy of gait analysis tool with machine learning enables capacity classify disparity existing hemiplegic gait hemiplegic gait is characterized by an affected and unaffected leg which quantified by measurement of force plate characteristic feature of force plate recording gait consist of two local maximum that represent braking and push off phase of stance and their associated parameter quantified feature of hemiplegic pair of affected and unaffected force plate recording intuitively disparate logistic regression achieves 100 classification between an affected and unaffected hemiplegic leg pair based feature set of force plate data
