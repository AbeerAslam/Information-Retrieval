detection of ssh brute force attack using aggregated netflow data intrusion detection brute force machine learning aggregated netflows ssh brute force attack is one of most prevalent attack computer network these attack aim gain ineligible access user account by trying plenty of different password combination detection of this type of attack network level overcome scalability issue of host based detection method this paper provide machine learning approach detection of ssh brute force attack network level since extracting discriminative feature any machine learning task is fundamental step explain process of extracting discriminative feature detection of brute force attack incorporate domain knowledge about ssh brute force attack well analysis of representative collection of data define feature collected real ssh traffic from campus network also generated some failed login data that legitimate user who forgotten his her password produce normal traffic that similar ssh brute force attack traffic our inspection collected brute force netflow data and manually produced ssh failed login data showed that netflow feature not discriminative enough discern brute force traffic from failed login traffic produced by legitimate user introduced an aggregation of netflows extract proper feature building machine learning model our result show that model built upon these feature provide excellent performance detection of brute force attack
