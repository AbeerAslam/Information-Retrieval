rbf firmlp architecture digit recognition firmlp neural network handwritten digit recognition mnist mnist variation pattern recognition finite impulse response multilayer perceptron firmlp is multilayer perceptron where static weight been replaced by finite impulse response filter hereby it represents model spatio temporal processing this paper present temporal processing neural network which is based firmlp but some layer been replaced by temporal radial basis function rbf unit training algorithm used temporal backpropagation not just adapting weight but also finding center and width of rbf layer well performance comparison been done task of handwritten digit ecognition by using mnist and mnist variation database
