impact of noise from group based label collection visual classification visual classification noisy training data group based labeling state of art visual classification continues improve particularly with use of deep learning and million of labeled image however effort required label training set of this size led semi supervised approach that collect partially noisy labeled data with less effort label noise been shown degrade supervised learning but these analysis focus noise from erroneous label assignment of data instance group based labeling reduces workload by assigning single label group of image simultaneously which introduces label noise with structure dependent training instance this work investigates impact of group based label noise classifier learning and discusses how and why this differs from instance based label noise also discus label noise modeling designed provide more robust classification given noisy training instance and evaluate generalization of these technique group based noise
