learning convex piecewise linear machine data driven optimal control learning convex function data driven optimal control piecewise linear data driven optimal control op scheme one or more involved component such objective function system dynamic or operation constraint described with statistical model and learned from data this work focus machine learning of operation constraint which is rarely addressed previous research although rich collection of supervised learning method exist literature most of them not suitable modeling operation constraint because their decision rule usually induce undesirable non linear coupling system variable order surpass simple linear model while same time maintaining compatibility with downstream control application propose describe system operation requirement by convex piecewise linear machine cplm which doe not incur any difficulty optimization and is directly pluggable generalization performance of proposed classifier is analyzed through bounding it vc dimension and large margin cost sensitive learning objective is formulated with bayes consistent hinge loss solve training problem by online stochastic gradient descent and propose mixed integer based initialization method case study heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system control with comfort requirement is conducted and result show that cplm is not only promising candidate cost sensitive learning general but also enables much better description and exploitation of system operation region optimal control purpose
