nonparametric bayesian modeling automated database schema matching computational modeling bayes method government data integration database metadata problem of merging database arises many government and commercial application schema matching common first step identifies equivalent field between database introduce schema matching framework that build nonparametric bayesian model each field and compare them by computing probability that single model could generated both field our experiment show that our method is more accurate and faster than existing instance based matching algorithm part because of use of nonparametric bayesian model
