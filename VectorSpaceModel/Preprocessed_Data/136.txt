predictable feature analysis data analysis dimensionality reduction feature extraction model building predictability self organization signal analysis unsupervised learning every organism an environment whether biological robotic or virtual must able predict certain aspect of it environment order survive or perform whatever task is intended it need model that is capable of estimating consequence of possible action so that planning control and decision making become feasible scientific purpose such model usually created problem specific manner using differential equation and other technique from control and system theory contrast that aim an unsupervised approach that build desired model self organized fashion inspired by slow feature analysis sfa our approach is extract subsignals from input that behave predictable possible these predictable feature highly relevant modeling because predictability is desired property of needed consequence estimating model by definition our approach measure predictability with respect certain prediction model focus here solution of arising optimization problem and present tractable algorithm based algebraic method which call predictable feature analysis pfa prove that algorithm find globally optimal signal if this signal predicted with low error deal with case where optimal signal significant prediction error provide robust heuristically motivated variant of algorithm and verify it empirically additionally give formal criterion prediction model must meet suitable measuring predictability pfa setting and also provide suitable default model along with formal proof that it meet these criterion
