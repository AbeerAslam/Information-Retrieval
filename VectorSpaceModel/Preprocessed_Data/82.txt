next generation application layer ddos defence applying concept of outlier detection datastreams with concept drift simulation application layer ddos dynamic web domain intrusion detection amp defence data stream with concept drift outlier detection existing state of the art field of application layer ddos protection is generally designed and thus effective only static web domain best of our knowledge this paper is first one study problem of application layer ddos defense web site of dynamic content and or organization and under non trivial bot i e attack behavior main contribution of paper threefold 1 provide detailed taxonomy of existing and next generation application layer http based ddos attack 2 discus relevance of branch of data mining theory known data stream with concept drift problem of application layer ddos defense dynamic web domain 3 present outline of our next generation anti ddos system that is intended dynamic web domain facing different sophisticated variant of application layer ddos attack paper also includes some of our preliminary experimental result concerning detection of malicious web user session using proposed system
