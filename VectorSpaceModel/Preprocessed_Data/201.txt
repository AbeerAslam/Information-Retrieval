what learn next recommending command feature rich environment collaboration history recommender system software documentation computational modeling computer science despite an abundance of command make task easier perform user of feature rich application such development environment use only fraction of command available earlier work shown that command recommendation which given command usage history of set of user objective is predict command that is likely useful user learn improve usage of range of command available within such application this paper present new algorithm codis which is built upon three hypothesis first hypothesize that feature rich application there exists co occurrence pattern between command second hypothesize that user of feature rich application prevalent discovery pattern finally hypothesize that user need different recommendation based time elapsed between their last activity and time of recommendation show data submitted by many user of an integrated development environment eclipse that codis outperforms existing approach compared adagrad best performing baseline it achieves an improvement of 10 22 recall top n recommendation task n 20
