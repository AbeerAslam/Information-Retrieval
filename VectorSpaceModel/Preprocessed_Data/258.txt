inferring gene regulatory network by combining supervised and unsupervised method data mining machine learning network inference system biology supervised method inferring gene regulatory network grns perform well with good training data however when training data is absent these method not applicable unsupervised method not need training data but their accuracy is low this paper combine supervised and unsupervised method infer grns using time series gene expression data specifically use result obtained from unsupervised method train supervised method since result contain noise develop data cleaning algorithm remove noise hence improving quality of training data these refined training data then used guide classifier including support vector machine and deep learning tool infer grns through link prediction experimental result several data set demonstrate good performance of classifier and effectiveness of our data cleaning algorithm
