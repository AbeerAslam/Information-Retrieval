multifaceted approach bitcoin fraud detection global and local outlier kd tree anomaly outlier data mining random forest regression bitcoin network lack of class label tend cause obscurity anomalous financial behaviour interpretation understand fraud latest development of financial sector multifaceted approach is proposed this paper bitcoin fraud is described from both global and local perspective using trimmed k mean and kd tree two sphere investigated further through random forest maximum likelihood based and boosted binary regression model although both angle show good performance global outlier perspective outperforms local viewpoint with exception of random forest that exhibit nearby perfect result from both dimension this signifies that feature extracted this study describe network fairly
