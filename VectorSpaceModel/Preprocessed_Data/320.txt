feedforward neural network predicting duration of maintained software project software engineering software maintenance duration prediction multilayer feedforward neural network statistical regression isbsg once software project been developed and delivered any modification it corresponds maintenance software maintenance sm involves modification keep software project usable changed or changing environment reactive modification correct discovered fault and modification improve performance or maintainability since duration of sm should predicted this study after statistical analysis of project maintained several platform and programming language generation data set were selected training and testing multilayer feedforward neural network i e multilayer perceptron mlp these data set were obtained from international software benchmarking standard group result based wilcoxon statistical test show that prediction accuracy with mlp is statistically better than that with statistical regression model when software project were maintained 1 mid range platform and coded programming language of third generation and 2 multi platform and coded programming language of fourth generation
