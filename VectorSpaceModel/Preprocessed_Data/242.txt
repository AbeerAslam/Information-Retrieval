automatic optimization of localized kernel density estimation hotspot policing crime prediction hotspot mapping convolution filtering genetic algorithm kernel density estimation is popular method identifying crime hotspot purpose of data driven policing however computing kernel density estimate is computationally intensive large crime datasets and quality of resulting estimate depends heavily parameter that difficult set manually inspired by method from image processing propose novel way performing hotspot analysis using localized kernel density estimation optimized with an evolutionary algorithm proposed method us local learning address three challenge associated with traditional kernel density estimation computational complexity bandwidth selection and kernel function selection evaluate our localized kernel model 17 crime type from chicago illinois usa preliminary result indicate significant improvement prediction performance over traditional approach also examine effect of data sparseness performance of both model
