classification of occluded object using fast recurrent processing recurrent processing occlusion neural network recurrent neural network powerful tool handling incomplete data problem computer vision thanks their significant generative capability however computational demand these algorithm is too high work real time without specialized hardware or software solution this paper propose framework augmenting recurrent processing capability into feedforward network without sacrificing much from computational efficiency assume mixture model and generate sample of last hidden layer according class decision of output layer modify hidden layer activity using sample and propagate lower layer visual occlusion problem iterative procedure emulates feedforward feedback loop filling in missing hidden layer activity with meaningful representation proposed algorithm is tested widely used dataset and shown achieve 2 improvement classification accuracy occluded object when compared restricted boltzmann machine our algorithm show superior performance occluded object classification
