home appliance energy disaggregation using low frequency data and machine learning classifier smart energy smart housing disaggregation non intrusive load monitoring neural network feature selection home appliance monitoring provides useful information about appliance usage which used better inform user about their consumption habit and promote energy conservation however metering load is cost prohibitive instead many tried disaggregate load from aggregate power measurement existing approach that require submetering high resolution power signal of individual appliance during training and testing impractical and economically infeasible this paper introduce low cost approach home appliance monitoring based observation made single circuit our approach consists of three step first apply neural network classifier segment input power signal then apply another classifier label each segment an individual appliance or multiple appliance finally iteratively disaggregate multi appliance segment with classifier previous step our proposed approach is evaluated two experiment first experiment us fully labeled public dataset consisting of 1 211 segment from 25 student bedroom university campus second experiment us 1 563 segment from redd public dataset evaluation show that our approach accurately detect those appliance that dominate energy consumption overall accuracy of 86 6 and 91 2 respectively also present an in depth analysis of failure and conjecture why they harder detect
