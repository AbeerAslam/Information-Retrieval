an edge less approach horizon line detection horizon line detection skyline extraction support vector machine convolutional neural network dynamic programming horizon line is promising visual cue which exploited robot localization or visual geo localization prominent approach horizon line detection rely edge detection pre processing step which is inherently non stable approach due parameter choice and underlying assumption present novel horizon line detection approach which us machine learning and dynamic programming dp extract horizon line from classification map instead of an edge map key idea is assigning classification score each pixel which interpreted likelihood of pixel belonging horizon line and representing classification map multi stage graph using dp horizon line extracted by finding path that maximizes sum of classification score contrast edge map which typically binary edge v no edge and contain gap classification map continuous and contain gap yielding significantly better solution using classification map instead of edge map allows removing certain assumption such horizon is close top of image or that horizon form straight line purpose of these assumption is bias dp solution but they fail produce good result when they not valid demonstrate our approach three different data set and provide comparison with traditional approach based edge map although our training set is comprised of very small number of image from same location our result illustrate that our method generalizes well image acquired under different condition and geographical location
