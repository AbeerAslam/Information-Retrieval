feature fusion denoising and sparse autoencoders application neuroimaging data deep learning alzheimer s disease stage detection feature fusion sacked sparse autoencoders stacked denoising autoencoders although there is cure date alzheimer s disease detection early stage significant impact patient s life term of cost progress and helping plan advance an appropriate healthcare life ahead well providing clinical etiology further research this paper discusses implementing feature fusion method utilizing sparse and denoising autoencoders reveal stage of alzheimer s disease four cohort consisted of individual with alzheimer s disease late mild cognitive impairment early mild cognitive impairment and normal control group classified using multinomial logistic regression fueled by fusion of high level and low level feature high level feature extracted from stacked autoencoders result show that feature fusion enhance performance of typical autoencoders however performance of feature fusion using denoising autoencoders is superior that of sparse training of autoencoders term of overall accuracy precision and recall
