adaptive openmp task scheduling using runtime apis and machine learning adaptive scheduling machine learning ompt collector apis openmp task similarity analysis task based programming model adopt different scheduling strategy exploit parallelism irregular application these scheduling strategy differ term of exploiting data locality maintaining load balance and minimizing overhead openmp task allow programmer express unstructured parallelism high level of abstraction and make runtime responsible about burden of scheduling parallel execution irregular application performance of task scheduling not often predicted due nature of application used compiler and platform architecture dependency this work introduce an automatic portable and adaptive runtime feedback driven framework aparf that combine standard low level tasking runtime apis developed profiling tool and hybrid machine learning model employ aparf select optimum task scheduling scheme of any given application using similarity analysis through correlation between captured runtime apis with low profiling cost our hybrid model predicts best scheduling strategy variety of unseen application with an average accuracy of 93 while maintaining 100 training accuracy an average performance enhancement of 25 wa obtained compared with default configuration when aparf wa applied different unseen program aparf wa examined against real application molecular dynamic where achieved 31 performance improvement compared intel pgi and gnu compiler our predicted scheme achieved better performance most case
