evaluating uncertainty of bayesian network query response by using joint probability distribution bayesian network machine learning effective sample size variance of query response approximate inference bayesian network is powerful tool represent pattern inside past data it used predict future by calculating posterior probability of future event machine learning technique that construct bayesian network from past data automatically well developed recent year if consider past data sampling set from an original probabilistic distribution learning process is actually trying reproduce original probabilistic distribution from sampling set therefore finiteness of size of sampling set will bring uncertainty reproduced parameter of constructed bayesian network when constructed bayesian network is used predict future uncertainty of reproduced parameter will transferred uncertainty of query response here query response is posterior probability that interested evaluating uncertainty of query response is critical some strict industrial application previous research proposed method evaluate uncertainty consequence is shown variance of query response however conventional method need work together with bucket elimination an exact inference method therefore conventional method not deal with large bayesian network that used real application because of it calculation cost proposed new approach calculate uncertainty of query response by using joint probability distribution this research proposed method work with any inference method therefore it give an approximate evaluation even when bayesian network is large by using an approximate inference method investigate accuracy of our proposed method six well used public bayesian network used test case by comparing approximate result with exact result an average error of 13 60 is got
