intelligent crude oil price forecaster gaussian process ensemble learning online learning crude oil price forecasting linear regression support vector machine decision tree propose two ensemble regression algorithm forecasting daily price of crude oil from feature extracted from u s energy administration and some international news agency an ensemble regression model consists of group of homogeneous regressors with varying parameter e g linear regression model with different ridge regularization parameter first ensemble method called recent leader pick individual regressor with least mean square error over recent data second model called exponentially weighted ensemble combine individual regressors linear fashion with weight of constituent model decaying exponentially with mean square error over past prediction these two method were tested with linear regression support vector regression decision tree and gaussian process exponentially weighted ensemble with support vector regression best performance
