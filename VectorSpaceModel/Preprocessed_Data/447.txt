predicting psychosis using experience sampling method with mobile apps predicting psychosis esm mhealth svm gaussian process random forest neural network feature selection roc analysis monte carlo smart phone become ubiquitous recent year which opened new opportunity rediscovering experience sampling method esm new efficient form using mobile apps and provides great prospect become low cost and high impact mhealth tool psychiatry practice method is used collect longitudinal data of participant daily life experience and is ideal capture fluctuation emotion momentary mental state an early indicator later mental health disorder this study esm data of patient with psychosis and control were used examine emotion change and identify pattern this paper attempt determine whether aggregated esm data which statistical measure represent distribution and dynamic of original data able distinguish patient from control variable importance recursive feature elimination and relieff method were used feature selection model training and tuning and testing were performed nested cross validation and were based algorithm such random forest support vector machine gaussian process logistic regression and neural network roc analysis wa used post process these model stability of model performance wa studied using monte carlo simulation result provide evidence that pattern mood change captured with combination of technique used best result were achieved by svm with radial kernel where best model performed with 82 accuracy and 82 sensitivity
