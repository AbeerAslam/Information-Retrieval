effect of clustering data privacy data privacy privacy preserving anonymization clustering data diversity data obtained by various organization provide opportunity generating solution future it is essential that accurate data must sharable with research community and scientist order improve quality of life however accurate record of personal data include sensitive information about individual hence sharing these record without applying any anonymization criterion pave way disclosure of personal privacy an effort protect personal privacy privacy preserving data mining ppdm and privacy preserving data publishing ppdp approach been studied extensively numerous work been dedicated diversifying technique de identification or anonymization of identifiable datasets but there is an important trade off between data loss and data privacy while original data anonymized it exposed information loss order minimize information loss anonymization algorithm discard keeping diversity this study proposed an approach that us clustering algorithm pre process privacy preserving method improve diversity of anonymized data addition effect of clustering anonymization wa evaluated by using original and clustered form of real world dataset result evaluated with aspect of usability scientific work and it wa observed that clustering algorithm and an affective anonymization algorithm must used privacy preservation approach order keep diversity of original datasets
