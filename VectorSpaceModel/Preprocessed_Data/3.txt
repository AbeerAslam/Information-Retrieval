applying swarm ensemble clustering technique fault prediction using software metric software defect prediction particle swarm optimization cluster data ensemble clustering number of defect remaining system provides an insight into quality of system defect detection system predict defect by using software metric and data mining technique clustering analysis is adopted build software defect prediction model cluster ensemble emerged prominent method improving robustness stability and accuracy of clustering solution clustering ensemble combine multiple partition generated by different clustering algorithm into single clustering solution this paper clustering ensemble using particle swarm optimization algorithm pso solution is proposed improve predict quality an empirical study show that pso good choice build defect prediction software model
