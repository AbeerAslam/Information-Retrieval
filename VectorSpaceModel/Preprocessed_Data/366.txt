an evolutionary learning approach self configuring image pipeline context of carbon fiber fault detection online process monitoring organic computing evolutionary computing cgp image segmentation cfrp ndt carbon fiber reinforced plastic cfrp play key role production of leightweight structure simultaneously online quality inspection of cfrp becomes more important especially environment with high safety standard this context vision system aim find defect of different shape size contour and orientation little effort however been made detecting defect area image taken from surface of carbon fiber common approach segmenting filament defect edge detection and thresholding with every change of material and process adjustment filter parameter adapted this paper propose cartesian genetic programming cgp approach semi automatically select best parameter this strategy save time parameter identification while same time increase precision test run randomly selected sample show how approach substantially improve detection reliability
