ddos attack modeling and detection using smo computer crime clustering algorithm firewall computing flood classification algorithm feature extraction port computer over last decade distributed denial of service ddos attack been employed cause huge financial and prestige loss different kind of e business attacker also target governmental website using ddos attack new weapon world of cyber war importance of issue inspired many researcher from academia and industry provide solution this type of challenging attack this study simulated ddos attack virtual lab and then collected firewall log from security information and event management siem platform of company field of security management solution extracted 14 research feature from firewall log and applied smo algorithm train our data using 10 fold cross validation smo with polykernel wa able create prediction model without any false alarm also tested our model with two different datasets this research is an ongoing multistep study future research will concentrate online ddos detection
