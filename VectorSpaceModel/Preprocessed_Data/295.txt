temporal link prediction using time series of quasi local node similarity measure social network analysis evolving network node similarity link prediction narx neural network evolving network which composed of object and relationship that change over time prevalent many real world domain and become an significant research topic recent year most of previous link prediction study neglect evolution of network over time and mainly focus predicting future link based static feature of node and link however real world network complex dynamic structure and non linear varying topological feature which mean that both node and link of network may appear or disappear these dynamicity of network make link prediction more challenging task overcome these difficulty link prediction such network must model nonlinear temporal evolution of topological feature and link occurrence information of network structure simultaneously this article propose novel link prediction method based narx neural network evolving network our model first calculates similarity score based quasi local measure each pair of node different snapshot of network and create time series each pair then narx network is effectively applied prediction of future node similarity score by using past node similarity and node connectivity proposed method is tested dblp coauthorship network it is shown that combining time information with node similarity and node connectivity improves link prediction performance large extent
