component based architecture control of crossing region railway network control system component based design petri net railway crossing region research work this paper discusses an improved petri net model of railway crossing region which important and critical component of railway network control algorithm been developed showing interaction of controller other component of system formal approach viz petri net pn is applied model safety requirement of train along crossing region railway network modeling component based modeling and state oriented modeling approach been integrated first track component and control component identified interaction of identified component satisfying safety requirement is also defined high level architecture finally state oriented modeling approach been adopted design detailed model of crossing region further this paper us coverability tree verify specification of crossing region by taking crossing point center circular region is introduced safety purpose further safety property been defined term of place invariant which been verified by state space analysis
