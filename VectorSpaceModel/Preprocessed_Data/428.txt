human motion trajectory analysis based video summarization summarization human tracking trajectory analysis region of interest curve simplification multimedia technology is growing day by day and contributing towards enormous amount of video data especially area of security surveillance browsing through such large collection of video is challenging and time consuming task despite advancement technology automatic browsing retrieval manipulation and analysis of large video still far behind this paper fully automatic human centric system video summarization is proposed most of surveillance application human motion is of great interest proposed system moving part video detected using background subtraction and blob extracted from binary image human detection is done through histogram of oriented gradient hog using support vector machine svm classifier then motion of human is tracked through consecutive frame using kalman filter and trajectory of each person is extracted analysis of trajectory lead meaningful summary which cover only important part of video one also mark region of interest included summary experimental result show proposed system reduces long video into meaningful summary and save lot of time and cost term of storage indexing and browsing effort
