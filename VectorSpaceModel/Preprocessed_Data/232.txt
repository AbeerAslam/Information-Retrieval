prediction of continuous phenotype mouse fly and rice genome wide association study with support vector regression snp and ridge regression classifier phenotype prediction snp selection support vector regression genome wide association study ridge regression ranking of snp and prediction of phenotype continuous genome wide association study is subject of increasing interest with application personalized medicine and animal and plant breeding ranking of snp case control discrete label genome wide association study been examined several previous study with machine learning technique but this is poorly explored study with quantitative label here study ranking of snp mouse fly and rice continuous genome wide association study given by popular univariate pearson correlation coefficient and multivariate support vector regression and ridge regression perform cross validation with support vector regression and ridge regression model top ranked snp and compute correlation coefficient between true and predicted phenotype our result show that ridge regression prediction with top ranked support vector regression snp give highest accuracy datasets achieve accuracy comparable previously published value but with fewer snp our work show learn parsimonious snp model predicting continuous label genome wide study
