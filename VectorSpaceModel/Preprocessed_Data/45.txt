genetically supervised self organizing map classification of glass sample classification self organizing map genetic optimization and supervision self organizing map som is useful tool creating abstraction of high dimensional distribution of input it computes ideal mapping of domain of observation using either discrete or continuous distribution of value 1 som benefit from coupling with genetic algorithm ga gas optimization algorithm that allow user evolve solution from distribution of potential solution 2 fittest candidate survive and participate production of future generation of new solution fusion of these two technique result dynamic algorithm that map diverse input plane an optimizing fashion striving towards perfection while learning from mistake will detail general principle involved and demonstrate performance of this algorithm classification of glass sample
