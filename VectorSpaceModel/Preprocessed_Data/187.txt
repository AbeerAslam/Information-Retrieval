synthetic oversampling advanced radioactive threat detection machine learning classification class imbalance synthetic oversampling artificial neural network autoencoders gamma ray spectrum gamma ray spectral classification requires automatic identification of large background class and small minority class composed of instance that may pose risk human and environment accurate classification of such instance is required variety of domain spanning event and port security national monitoring failure industrial nuclear facility this work proposes novel form of synthetic oversampling based artificial neural network architecture and empirically demonstrates that it is superior state of the art synthetic oversampling target domain particular utilize gamma ray spectral data collected security purpose vancouver 2010 winter olympics and node of health canada s national monitoring network
