adaptive restructuring of radial basis function using integrate and fire neuron machine learning radial basis function neural network feed forward network this paper proposes neurobiology based extension of integrate and fire model of radial basis function neural network rbfnn that adapts novel stimulus by mean of dynamic restructuring of network structural parameter new architecture automatically balance synapsis modulation re center hidden radial basis function rbfs and stochastically shift parameter space decision plane maintain homeostasis example result provided throughout paper illustrate effect of change rbfnn model
