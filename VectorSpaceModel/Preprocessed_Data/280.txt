bird call identification using dynamic kernel based support vector machine and deep neural network bio acoustic bird call identification dynamic kernel support vector machine deep neural network this paper apply speech and audio processing technique bird vocalization and classification of bird found lower himalayan region mel frequency cepstral coefficient mfcc extracted from each recording result recording now represented varying length set of feature vector dynamic kernel based support vector machine svms and deep neural network dnns popularly used classification of such varying length pattern obtained from speech signal this work propose use dynamic kernel based svms and dnns classification of bird call represented set of feature vector result of our study show that both approach give comparable performance
