local and global data spread based index determining number of cluster dataset number of cluster dataset cluster validity clustering compactness measure of cluster distinctness measure of cluster most of clustering algorithm sensitive input parameter and produce different clustering result different input parameter same datasets number of method and index been proposed validating result of clustering process most commonly used approach cluster validation based internal index this paper propose new cluster validity index arspread index purpose of cluster validation and determining number of cluster present dataset local and global data spread based approach is proposed measure compactness of cluster distinctness measure that is based penalty function is incorporated proposed index conduct thorough comparison of five commonly known index with proposed index and provide summary of experimental performance of different index experimental result show that proposed new index performs better than commonly known index
