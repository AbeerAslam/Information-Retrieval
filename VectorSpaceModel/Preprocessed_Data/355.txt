predictive modelling strategy understand heterogeneous manifestation of asthma early life wheeze pre school feature selection predictive modelling roc analysis model post processing monte carlo wheezing is common among child and 50 of those under 6 year of age thought experience least one episode of wheeze however due heterogeneity of symptom there difficulty treating and diagnosing these child phenotype specific therapy is one possible avenue of treatment whereby use significant pathology and physiology identify and treat pre schoolers with wheeze by performing feature selection algorithm and predictive modelling technique this study will attempt determine if it is possible robustly distinguish patient diagnostic category among pre school child univariate feature analysis identified more objective variable and recursive feature elimination larger number of subjective variable important distinguishing between patient category predicative modelling saw drop performance when subjective variable were removed from analysis indicating that these variable important distinguishing wheeze class achieved 90 performance auc sensitivity specificity and accuracy and 80 kappa statistic distinguishing ill from healthy patient developed synergistic statistical machine learning approach our methodology propose also novel roc cross evaluation method model post processing and evaluation our predictive modelling s stability wa assessed computationally intensive monte carlo simulation
