multi variable neural network forecasting using two stage feature selection forecasting feature selection neural network this paper proposes novel neural network based forecaster that predicts more than one variable time two stage neural network training algorithm is used that employ newton algorithm estimate vector of hidden unit optimal learning factor each iteration order reduce size of neural network and train it more effectively forecaster us both subsetting and transformation type of feature selection reducing number of neural net input by 70
