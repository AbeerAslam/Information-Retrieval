solar radiation prediction improvement using weather forecast machine learning weather forecasting solar radiation irradiance random forest grib prediction model were developed generate forecast of solar radiation and by proxy expected solar plant power output one hour and 24 hour future data wa sourced from georgia automated environmental monitoring network gaemn and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa five city georgia early predictive model only made use of historical recorded solar radiation and other weather phenomenon input while later model incorporated weather forecast target area and surrounding area including weather forecast data prediction model resulted 7 6 reduction mean absolute error mae one hour prediction when compared using historical observation alone and 40 2 reduction mae 24 hour prediction result from several machine learning technique were compared with random forest achieving lowest error rate result indicate that weather forecast an important component of accurate solar radiation prediction even over short and medium term prediction timeframes and inclusion of surrounding geographical area addition target city is an important component of these prediction
