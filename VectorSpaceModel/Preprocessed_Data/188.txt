intelligent bus stop identification using smartphone sensor intelligent system bus transportation machine learning gps sensor intelligent transportation system built by developing model that learn from collected transport data data collection and implementation of such system is often costly and few country support such system their transportation budget place where maintaining currency and accuracy of information is difficult many problem arise instance chennai india real time bus transit data is not maintained there is proper communication about bus schedule bus stop not regularly updated and inconsistent information about bus stop is observed transport authority s website interested developing model identifying bus stop from trajectory situation where accurate and current information is not available and traffic condition challenging such chennai india develop simple yet easily accessible android mobile application app collect gps trace of bus route use our app collect gps trajectory data from baltimore maryland place where there facility access up to date information about bus stop also collect gps trajectory from chennai india then develop model using machine learning technique identify bus stop from collected trajectory experimentally evaluate our model by training it baltimore dataset and testing it chennai dataset achieving testing accuracy between 85 90 this is comparable accuracy of 95 achieved by both training and testing chennai dataset this illustrates that our approach is effective helping maintain an accurate and current transport information system resource constraint environment
