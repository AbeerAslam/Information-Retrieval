detecting smooth cluster change evolving graph spectral clustering evolving graph graph sequence clustering vertex graph or sequence of graph important application network science bioinformatics and other area most research date focused static graph or sequence where number of vertex doe not change propose new algorithm that successfully partition vertex of graph sequence into smooth cluster even when number of vertex is allowed vary over time our approach us spectral clustering and relies applying k partition problem graph constructed from input graph sequence several experiment demonstrate performance of our method and it advantage over existing method
