automated detection of adenoviral conjunctivitis disease from facial image using machine learning adenoviral conjunctivitis pink eye grabcut gray level co occurrence matrix glcm sclera segmentation vascularization nowadays scientist focusing diagnosing certain eye disease using image processing among these disease adenoviral conjunctivitis is key eye infection observed and diagnosed this paper digital image processing dip is applied an automated fast and cost effective diagnosis of conjunctivitis by physician our study measure vascularization and intensity of redness pink eye after segmenting region of infection corneal image diagnose conjunctivitis corneal image captured using our simple setup and processed through proposed dip approach successfully detects eye infection and isolates potentially contagious patient correctly 93 of time were able achieve this rate by isolating sclera region using automated grabcut method that identifies seed region from image itself such adaptive isolation of region of interest overcomes challenge presented by lightning and resolution during this study evaluated performance of known dip method and incorporated them eye disease diagnosis
