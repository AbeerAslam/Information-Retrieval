mapreduce based classification fault detection big data application fault detection big data application mapreduce bayesian classification recently emerging software application large complex distributed and data intensive i e big data application that make monitoring of such application challenging task due lack of standard and technique modeling and analysis of execution data i e log produced by such application another challenge imposed by big data application is that execution data produced by such application also high volume velocity variety and require high veracity value this paper present our monitoring solution that performs real time fault detection big data application our solution is two fold first prescribe standard model structuring execution log second prescribe bayesian classification based analysis solution that is mapreduce compliant distributed parallel single pas and incremental that make it possible our proposed solution deployed and executed cloud computing platform process log produced by big data application carried out complexity scalability and usability analysis of our proposed solution that how efficiently and effectively it perform fault detection big data application
