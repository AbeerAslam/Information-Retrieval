neural network based handover management strategy heterogeneous network neural network based machine learning vertical handoff vho neural network classifier qos over heterogeneous network one of key challenge improvement of quality of service qos heterogeneous wireless network is design of vertical handover vho management strategy vho is required guide decision mobile terminal mt handoff between different type of network this is an essential task cope with various multimedia service qos setting this paper present machine learning scheme based neural network call vertical handover heterogeneous network neural network based handover management scheme nnbhms of this paper aim toward achieving seamless connectivity and always best connected abc call status group mobility over set of heterogeneous network proposed scheme evaluates and creates relationship between different decision criterion related heterogeneous network condition terminal capability application requirement and user preference afterward estimate of each attribute forwarded neural network select optimal access network proposed scheme is applied vertical handover management heterogeneous network offering both real time service voice over ip service and data service packet data traffic through implementation of neural network based machine learning approach proposed research scheme allows solving complexity of handover decision process resulting from multitude dimension of decision criterion and dynamicity of many of it component performance result evaluated through simulation show that use of neural network based machine learning scheme carry out handover process enhance qos perceived by both type of voice and data service while fulfilling great extent user preference
