frequent set mining streaming mixed and large data frequent set mining discretization large data mixed data streaming frequent set mining is well researched problem due it application many area of data mining such clustering classification and association rule mining most of existing work focus categorical and batch data and not scale well large datasets this work focus frequent set mining mixed data introduce discretization methodology find meaningful bin boundary when itemsets contain least one continuous attribute an update strategy keep frequent item relevant event of concept drift and parallel algorithm find these frequent item our approach identifies local bin per itemset global discretization may not identify most meaningful bin since relationship between attribute my change over time rule updated using weighted average method our algorithm fit well hadoop framework so it scaled large datasets
