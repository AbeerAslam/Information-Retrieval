validation of quantifier based fuzzy classification system breast cancer patient external independent cohort rule based classification fuzzy rule validation breast cancer recent study breast cancer domain identified seven distinct clinical phenotype group using immunohistochemical analysis and variety of unsupervised learning technique consensus among clustering algorithm been used categorise patient into these specific group but often expense of not classifying patient it is known that fuzzy methodology provide linguistic based classification rule ease those from consensus clustering objective of this study is present validation of recently developed extension of fuzzy quantification subsethood based algorithm three set of newly available breast cancer data result show that our algorithm is able reproduce seven biological class previously identified preserving their characterisation term of marker distribution and therefore their clinical meaning moreover because our algorithm constitutes fundamental basis of newly developed nottingham prognostic index plus npi our finding demonstrate that this new medical decision making tool help moving towards more tailored care breast cancer
