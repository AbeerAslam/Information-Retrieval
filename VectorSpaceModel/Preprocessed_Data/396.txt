new framework fine tuning of deep network deep learning deep neural network fine tuning drop out technique gain parameter and drop out technique very often training of deep neural network involves two learning phase unsupervised pretraining and supervised fine tuning unsupervised pretraining is used learn parameter of deep neural network while supervised fine tuning improves upon what been learnt pretraining stage predominant algorithm that is used supervised fine tuning of deep neural network is standard backpropagation algorithm however field of shallow neural network number of modification backpropagation algorithm been proposed that improved performance of trained model this paper propose hybrid approach that integrates gain parameter based backpropagation algorithm and dropout technique and evaluate it effectiveness fine tuning of deep neural network three benchmark datasets result indicate that proposed hybrid approach performs better fine tuning than backpropagation algorithm alone
