an accurate fast embedded feature selection svms rfe feature selection embedded method support vector machine recursive feature addition feature selection is still vital area research machine learning field after emergence of big data need mining large data size increased provide faster and more accurate prediction feature selection is concerned with selecting most important feature from set of input feature since some datasets may contain irrelevant and or redundant feature this paper new feature selection method of type embedded is presented and discussed with some preliminary result using existing benchmark datasets new method is called recursive feature addition which work forward fashion and is based support vector machine new method been applied five different benchmark datasets and which it shown superior performance term of accuracy and time compared filter wrapper and other embedded method
