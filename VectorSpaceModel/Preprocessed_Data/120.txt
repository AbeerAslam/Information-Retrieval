performance analysis of majority vote combiner multiple classifier system multiple classifier system majority vote rule probability of classification error combining rule multiple classifier system mc play central role shaping their performance classification error probability many theoretical work developed predict performance using different combining rule some of developed work assumed that classifier output independent however practice an ensemble of classifier show dependent behavior between each other this work theoretical model is derived estimating misclassification error probability of mc based majority vote combiner derivation assumed that each classifier produce it output an estimation of posterior class probability that gaussian distribution addition assumed that each classifier two class and output of classifier dependent and identically distributed validated our model using computer simulation result show that ensemble performance is highly sensitive class variance while exhibit smoother behavior against class mean also result show that correlation among classifier output increase probability of classification error degrades exponentially trend continues until performance reach behavior of single classifier regardless of number of base classifier used ensemble proposed model provides better understanding of behavior of majority vote combiner mc
