investigating transfer learner robustness domain class imbalance transfer learning domain class imbalance traditional machine learning class imbalance transfer learning environment is characterized by machine learning algorithm being trained with data from one domain source domain and being tested data from different domain target domain transfer learning scenario class probability of source domain may different from class probability of target domain which is referred domain class imbalance domain class imbalance is different from class imbalance class imbalance refers condition of single domain having unequal class probability traditional machine learning training and testing data drawn from single domain effect of class imbalance traditional machine learning well studied however issue of domain class imbalance field of transfer learning received little research attention this paper provides comparative performance test of state of the art transfer learning algorithm using wide range of domain class imbalance combination detailed discussion relative performance of different algorithm with statistical validation is presented different domain class imbalance scenario
