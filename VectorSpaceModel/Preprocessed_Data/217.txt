improved wind power forecasting using combination method wind power forecasting forecast combination lp norm estimator fuzzy soft set regression tree random forest integration of wind power into existing transmission grid is an important issue due discontinuous and volatile behavior of wind moreover power plant owner need reliable information about day ahead power production market operation therefore wind power forecasting approach been gaining importance renewable energy research area wind power monitoring and forecast system turkey ritm currently monitor growing number of wind power plant turkey and us wind power measurement addition different numerical weather prediction generate short term power forecast forecasting model of ritm give considerably good result individually however forecast combination approach frequently used order not rely single forecast model and also utilize forecast diversification this paper an analysis of wind power domain and current wind power forecasting method of ritm presented then three main forecast combination approach namely lp norm based combination fss fuzzy soft set based combination and tree based combination proposed provide better forecast these combination method been verified forecast data of ritm term of normalized mean absolute error nmae metric experimental result show that of applied combination method give lower nmae rate most of wind power plant compared individual forecast
