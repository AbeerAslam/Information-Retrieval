metabolic profiling of 1h nmr spectrum chronic kidney disease with local predictive modeling predictive model nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics feature extraction biological system modeling space exploration disease metabolic profiling study of change concentration of metabolite organism induced by biological difference within subpopulation deal with very large amount of complex data it therefore requires use of powerful data processing and machine learning method overcome over fitting common concern metabolic profiling where number of feature is often much larger than number of observation many predictive analysis combined dimension reduction technique with multivariate predictive linear modeling moreover they built global model that identifies biomarkers predictive of output of interest giving their overall trend variation however this fails capture local biological phenomenon underlying subgroup of subject more recently local exploration method based decision tree approach been applied metabolomics but they only explore random part of feature space this study used supervised rule mining algorithm that locally and exhaustively explores feature space predict chronic kidney disease cdk stage based proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr data from discriminant subregions obtained with this exploration extracted local feature and learned l2 regularized logistic regression l2lr classifier compared resulting local predictive model with standard one combining classical univariate supervised feature selection technique with l2lr and model mixing both global and local feature result show that local predictive model is more powerful term of predictive performance than mixed and global model additionally it give key insight into biological variation specific subgroup of subject
