automatic algorithm recognition of source code using machine learning algorithm recognition machine learning feature recognition codebases software project get larger reaching range of million of line of code need computer aided program comprehension grows define one of task of program comprehension algorithm recognition given piece of source code from file identify algorithm this code is implementing such brute force or dynamic programming most research this area is making use of pattern matching which involves much human effort and is of questionable accuracy when structure and semantics of program change thus this paper proposes let go of defined pattern and make use of simpler feature such count of variable and count of different construct recognize algorithm then feed these feature classification algorithm predict class or type of algorithm used this source code show through experimental result that our proposed method achieves good improvement over baseline
