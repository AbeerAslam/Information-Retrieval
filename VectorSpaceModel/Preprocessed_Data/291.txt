automatic algorithm selection computational software using machine learning resultant meta algorithm superfunctions algorithm choice automatic selection maple mathematica runtime improvement computational software program such maple and mathematica heavily rely superfunctions and meta algorithm select optimal algorithm given task these meta algorithm may require intensive mathematical proof formulate incur large computational overhead or fail consistently select best algorithm machine learning demonstrates promising alternative automatic algorithm selection by easing design process and overhead while also attaining high accuracy selection case study resultant superfunction trained neural network is able select best algorithm out of four available 86 of time maple and 78 of time mathematica when used replacement pre existing meta algorithm neural network brings about 68 runtime improvement maple and 49 improvement mathematica random forest k nearest neighbor and both linear and rbf kernel svms also compared neural network model latter of which offer best performance out of tested machine learning method
