forecasting domestic hot water demand residential house using artificial neural network artificial neural network domestic hot water forecasting energy demand prediction of domestic hot water energy consumption is key purpose order decrease energy consumed residential house advantage use artificial neural network method is it capacity adapt particular consumer without consumption profile lot of paper develop artificial neural network model predict energy consumption but they use high quantity of parameter in this study develop model with only available information classical installation separate our experimental data three kind of instant near zero consumption low consumption and high consumption moment and compare result of three model based neural network method each of these kind of consumption measure reaction time between prediction and real consumption moment result show that our model give good accuracy predict moment of consumption and value of high consumption moment
