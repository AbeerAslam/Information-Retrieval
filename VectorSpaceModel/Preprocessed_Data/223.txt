neural network based kidney segmentation from mr image preliminary result kidney segmentation neural network mr image automated and robust kidney segmentation from medical image sequence is very difficult task particularly because of gray level similarity of adjacent organ partial volume effect and injection of contrast medium addition these difficulty variation kidney shape position and gray level make automated identification and segmentation of kidney harder also different image characteristic with different scanner much more increase difficulty of segmentation task therefore this paper present an automated kidney segmentation method by using multi layer perceptron based approach that adapts parameter according image handle these challenging problem efficiency term of segmentation performance is achieved by using information from previously segmented kidney image proposed approach is also efficient term of required processing time since it doe not include pre processing and training stage which very time consuming moreover unsupervised segmentation approach eliminates common problem of most neural network based approach that is dependency of result chosen data training stage
