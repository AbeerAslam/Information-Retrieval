an analysis of instance selection neural network improve training speed instance selection neural network training speed training artificial neural network ann is relatively slow compared many other machine learning algorithm this study focus instance selection improve training speed first evaluate effectiveness of instance selection algorithm k nearest neighbor algorithm with ann then analyze factor accuracy distance from decision boundary dense region and class distribution and propose new instance selection algorithm discus tradeoff between accuracy and training speed and introduce measure tradeoff our empirical result real data set indicate that our proposed rdi is more effective with ann
