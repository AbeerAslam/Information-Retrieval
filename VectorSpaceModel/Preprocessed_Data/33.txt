geometric pdes weighted graph semi supervised classification equation database standard labeling vector image processing classification algorithm this paper consider adaptation of two partial differential equation pdes weighted graph p laplacian and eikonal equation semi supervised classification task these equation discrete analogue of well known geometric pdes which widely used image processing while p laplacian graph wa intensively used data classification few work relate eikonal equation data classification method illustrated through semi supervised classification task database where compare two algorithm result show that these method perform well regarding state of the art and applicable task of semi supervised classification
