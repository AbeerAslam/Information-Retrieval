using spectral feature improve sentiment analysis feature discovery spectral learning discrete fourier sentiment analysis common approach sentiment classification is identify set of sentiment carrying word and then use machine learning build classifier that classify sentiment based presence absence of those word this paper propose fourier based extension of this approach specifically introduce spectral learning algorithm that implicitly identifies sentiment carrying word and higher order function of those word it learns assign real valued sentiment score document spectral learner extends word presence model by applying boolean logic operator and or and xor word presence feature identify useful higher order feature these spectral feature used other learning algorithm and show how performance of other learning algorithm improved by these feature finally consider problem of determining which of pair of review express more positive overall sentiment and show that spectral learner identify very small distinction sentiment with better than random accuracy while larger distinction correctly identified with high accuracy
