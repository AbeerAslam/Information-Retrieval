study effect of different control period of neural network based reference modified pid control dc dc converter neural network dc dc converter control period computational burden this paper study about computational burden of reference modified pid with neural network prediction dc dc converter flexible control method required realize superior transient response since converter nonlinear behavior however computational burden becomes problem implement control computation device this paper neural network is adopted improve transient response of output voltage of dc dc converter under consideration of it computational burden neural network computation part longer computation period than pid main control part it possible since neural network give more than one prediction which required reference modification each main control period therefore reference modification adopted every main control period from result it is confirmed that proposed method improve transient response effectively with reducing computational burden of neural network control
