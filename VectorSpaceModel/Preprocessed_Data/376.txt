lecture vdeo indexing using boosted margin maximizing neural network video indexing image matching convolutional neural network boosting this paper present novel approach lecture video indexing using boosted deep convolutional neural network system indexing is performed by matching high quality slide image which text is either known or extracted lower resolution video frame with possible noise perspective distortion and occlusion propose deep neural network integrated with boosting framework composed of two sub network targeting feature extraction and similarity determination perform matching trained network is given input pair of slide image and candidate video frame image and produce similarity between them boosting framework is integrated into our proposed network during training process experimental result show that proposed approach is much more capable of handling occlusion spatial transformation and other type of noise when compared with known approach
