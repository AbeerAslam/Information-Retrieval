gaussian mixture model cluster forest cluster forest clustering ensemble clustering gaussian mixture expectation maximization random forest rf classification algorithm is widely used area of information retrieval and became basis some extended branch of classification and or regression algorithm cluster forest cf represents particular branch and brings usually better result than individual clustering algorithm this article describes new ensemble clustering algorithm based cf that internally us probabilistic model called gaussian mixture model gmm finally expectation maximization algorithm is used estimation of gmm parameter proposed ensemble clustering algorithm will compared with several different approach and tested eight datasets
