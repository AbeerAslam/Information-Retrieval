novel bayesian network based scheme finding optimal solution stochastic online equi partitioning problem bayes method partitioning algorithm meteorology noise stochastic process convergence probabilistic logic number of intriguing decision scenario such order picking revolve around partitioning collection of object so optimize some application specific objective function it general form this problem is referred object partitioning problem oop known np hard here consider variant of opp namely stochastic online equi partitioning problem so epp so epp object arrive sequentially pair relationship between arriving object pair is stochastic they belong same partition with probability p from history of object arrival goal is predict which object will appear together future arrival an additional complication partition of related object required of equal cardinality decision maker however is not informed about true relation between object he is merely observing stream of object pair and predict future behavior inferring correct partitioning from historical behavior is thus significant challenge which becomes even more difficult when p is unknown previously only heuristic sub optimal solution strategy been proposed so epp this paper propose first it optimal solution strategy brief scheme that propose bn epp is founded bayesian network representation of so epp problem based probabilistic reasoning not only able infer correct object partitioning with optimal accuracy also able simultaneously infer p allowing u accelerate learning object pair arrive being optimal bn epp provides superior performance compared existing state of the art solution scheme bn epp is also highly flexible being capable of encoding object partitioning constraint finally bn epp is parameter free it performance doe not rely fine tuning any parameter result of these advantage bn epp open significantly improved performance oop based application
