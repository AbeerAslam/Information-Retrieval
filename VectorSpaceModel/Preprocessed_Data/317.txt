big data analytics framework supporting multidimensional mining over big healthcare data mining big data big healthcare data healthcare system nowadays great deal of attention is being devoted big data analytics complex healthcare environment fetal growth curve which classical case of big healthcare data used prenatal medicine early detect potential fetal growth problem estimate perinatal outcome and promptly treat possible complication however currently adopted curve and related diagnostic technique been criticized because of their poor precision new technique based idea of customized growth curve been proposed literature this perspective problem of building customized or personalized fetal growth curve by mean of big data technique is discussed this paper proposed framework introduces idea of summarizing massive amount of input big data via multidimensional view top of which well known data mining method like clustering and classification applied this overall defines multidimensional mining approach targeted complex healthcare environment preliminary analysis effectiveness of framework is also proposed
