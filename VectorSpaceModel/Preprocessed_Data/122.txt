complex decomposition of negative distance kernel svm kernel function text categorization support vector machine svm become very popular machine learning method text classification one reason this relates range of existing kernel which allow classifying data that is not linearly separable linear polynomial and rbf gaussian radial basis function kernel commonly used and serve basis of comparison our study show how derive primal form of quadratic power kernel pk also called negative euclidean distance kernel ndk by mean of complex number exemplify ndk framework of text categorization using dewey document classification ddc target scheme our evaluation show that power kernel produce f score that comparable reference kernel but is except linear kernel faster compute finally show how extend ndk approach by including mahalanobis distance
