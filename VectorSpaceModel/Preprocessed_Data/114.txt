influence of sample reconstruction stock trend prediction via narx neural network trend prediction stock trading point narx sample reconstruction artificial neural network our study through established narx neural network model sample data of stock aapl nasdaq from 2006 01 01 2015 01 01 utilized training result show that under same sampling frequency with increase of ma period trend of volatility becomes lower with obvious longer time delay which will help predict trend of movement addition through use of reconstructed data containing trend information training sample it significantly reduced prediction error which is 16 29 lower than using daily training sample and 16 90 lower than using weekly training sample output directly reflect probability of trend movement every time point stock price it also improves generalization ability of narx model so predict stock trend change certain time it successfully estimated possibility of buying and selling point which provides necessary theoretical basis how determine stock trading point
