incremental dynamic search solver timetabling stochastic local search combinatorial optimization constraint programming this paper introduces incremental dynamic search id solver local search based solver propose solving general finite constraint satisfaction and combinatorial optimization problem goal of id solver is offer pluggable approach constraint based model well platform composing framework parallel local search extension whose functionality is determined by modelled problem aim of solver is improve efficiency robustness and usability of local based search algorithm proposed solver along with it parallel extension presented this paper
