sequential logistic principal component analysis slpca dimensional reduction streaming multivariate binary state system energy end use model dimensional reduction sequential optimization sequential or online dimensional reduction is of interest due explosion of streaming data based application and requirement of adaptive statistical modeling many emerging field such modeling of energy end use profile principal component analysis pca is classical way of dimensional reduction however traditional singular value decomposition svd based pca fails model data which largely deviate from gaussian distribution bregman divergence wa recently introduced achieve generalized pca framework if random variable under dimensional reduction follow bernoulli distribution which occurs many emerging field generalized pca is called logistic pca lpca this paper extend batch lpca sequential version i e slpca based sequential convex optimization theory convergence property of this algorithm is discussed compared batch version of lpca i e blpca well it performance reducing dimension multivariate binary state system it application building energy end use profile modeling is also investigated
