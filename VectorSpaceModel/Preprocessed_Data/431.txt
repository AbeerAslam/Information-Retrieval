audio signal reconstruction using cartesian genetic programming evolved artificial neural network cgpann audio signal reconstruction neural network signal processing propose novel audio signal reconstruction model that make use of non linear estimation algorithm called cartesian genetic programming evolved artificial neural network cgpann cgpann estimate non linear graph of audio signal with much better accuracy than it counterpart interpolation and extrapolation compared them term of snr improvement and ability deal with disputed data unlike other conventional reconstruction algorithm proposed algorithm restore signal which is damaged 50 by noise state of the art approach reconstructing an audio signal utilizing machine learning is presented this paper performance of algorithm is evaluated by measuring it signal to noise snr improvement and difference between original and reconstructed signal term of mean absolute percentage error mape snr improvement of 20 db is recorded single point estimation with 25 missing sample 19 db multi point 5 estimation which half of data is missing and 16 db signal with random variable noise
