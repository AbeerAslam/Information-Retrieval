time sensitive adaptation of regularization strength of recurrent neural network accurate learning recurrent neural network long short term memory regularization time varying impact penalization regularization is an important issue neural network because of strong expression power causing overfitting data regularization method is penalize cost function by activation based penalty it application recurrent neural network method usually assigns penalty uniformly distributed over time step however required strength recurrent network differs by time step this paper propose new activation based penalty function varying it strength over time step recurrent neural network verify it impact conducted practical experiment predict power consumption of home appliance result proposed method reduced training error and maintained validation and test error which implies improvement of forecasting ability sensitivity analysis method restricted sudden decrease of impact of early time step cost
