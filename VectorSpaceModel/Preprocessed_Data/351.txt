modeling over dispersion network data clustering over dispersion network data clustering cluster size distribution network community image segment over dispersed network data mining emerged central theme data science evident by sharp increase volume of real world network data with imbalanced cluster while most of existing clustering method designed discovering number of cluster and class specific connectivity pattern few method available uncover imbalanced cluster commonly existing network community and image segment from network data with over dispersed cluster size distribution latter is considered an intrinsic structural property of network data this paper propose generalized probabilistic modeling framework sizeconnectivity estimate over dispersed cluster size distribution together with class specific connectivity pattern from network data wide range of cluster size distribution revealed by real world network data accurately captured by our method performed extensive synthetic and real world experiment clustering social network data and image data detecting network community and image segment our result demonstrate superior performance of our sizeconnectivity clustering method recovering hidden structure of network data via modeling over dispersion
