deep learning microalgae classification microalgae classification imbalanced class deep learning convolutional neural network data augmentation microalgae unicellular organism that present limited physical characteristic such size shape or even present structure classifying them manually may require great effort from expert since thousand of microalgae found small sample of water furthermore manual classification is non trivial operation proposed deep learning technique solve problem also created classified dataset that allow u adopt this technique best of our knowledge present work is first one apply this kind of technique microalgae classification task obtained result show capability of method properly classify data by using input low resolution image acquired by particle analyzer instead of pre processed feature also show improvement provided by use of data augmentation technique
