high precision screening android malware with dimensionality reduction dimensionality reduction mobile security android principal component analysis this work present new method of classifying previously unseen android application malware or benign algorithm start with large set of feature frequency of possible n byte sequence application s byte code principal component analysis is applied that frequency matrix order reduce it low dimensional representation which is then fed into any of several classification algorithm utilize implicitly restarted lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm and exploit sparsity of n gram frequency matrix order efficiently compute low dimensional representation when trained upon that low dimensional representation several classification algorithm achieve higher accuracy than previous work
