multimodal sparsity eager support vector machine music classification audio classification multimodal demand multimedia grows development of information retrieval system utilizing available data modality becomes of paramount importance provision of multiple modality is motivated by usability presence of noise one modality and non universality of single modality radio station and music tv channel hold archive of million of music tape and lyric gigabyte of music file also spread over web along with lyric and metadata each file searching and organizing large scale multimodal datasets is challenging task supervised method such support vector machine svm achieve state of art performance music classification single modality but suffer from over fitting training example and limitation of single modality approach this paper introduce classifier fusion of multimodal audio and lyric data address these single modality classification limitation introduce multimodal l1 svm classifier that utilizes sparse method deal with over fitting music classification compare classification accuracy of fusion classifier genre classification task large public dataset with single modality l1 svm
