recognition and analysis of contour drawn during poppelreuter s test poppelreuter s test parkinson s disease contour recognition shape recognition this study aim digitalize poppelreuter s overlapping figure test poppelreuter s test used psychology and neurology assess visual perceptual function it recent modification performed with pencil and paper replacing pencil and paper by tablet computer equipped with stylus allows recording and analyzing fine motor motion observed during test one hand this provides an opportunity compute measure describing condition of participant other hand this possess two major problem tackled first one is recognize contour of overlapping object drawn by participant case of severe neurologic disorder dissimilarity between etalon shape and drawn contour may very high second problem is identify error made during drawing both problem addressed within this study traditional machine learning technique k mean k nearest neighbor and random forest used this study identify drawn contour and drawing mistake finally demonstrate applicability of proposed approach kinematic parameter analyzed pilot group of parkinson disease patient and healthy individual
