multiview centroid based fuzzy classification of large data classification soft clustering multiview data modern data is increasingly complex high dimensionality heterogeneity and independent multiple representation basic property of today s data with increasing source of data collection single object multiple representation which call view this paper propose multiview classification technique which us fuzzy mapping obtain maximum similarity between an object and nearest multiview centroid our fuzzy mapping based approach obtains unit l1 hyperplane common space each view establish efficacy of our proposed method present experimental comparison with number of baseline two synthetic and two real world data set
