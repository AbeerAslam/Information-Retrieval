learning effective query management strategy from big data query relaxation functional dependency web based information source availability of big data collection together with powerful hardware and software mechanism process them give nowadays possibility learn useful insight from data which exploited multiple purpose including marketing fault prevention and so forth however it is also possible learn important metadata that suggest how data should manipulated several advanced operation this paper show potentiality of learning from data by focusing problem of relaxing result of database query that is trying return some approximated answer query when result it is unavailable database and system will return an empty answer set or even worse erroneous mismatch result particular introduce novel approach rewrite query that disjunctive normal form and contain mixture of discrete and continuous attribute approach preprocesses data collection discover implicit relationship that exist among various domain attribute and then us this knowledge rewrite constraint from failing query first step approach try learn set of functional dependency from data which ranked according special mechanism that will successively allow predict order which extracted dependency used properly rewrite failing query an experimental evaluation of approach three real data set show it effectiveness term of robustness and coverage
