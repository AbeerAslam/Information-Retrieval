new video steganography algorithm based multiple object tracking and hamming code video steganography motion based multiple object tracking hamming code embedding efficiency eembedding payload modern world video steganography become popular option secret data communication performance of any steganography algorithm is based embedding efficiency embedding payload and robustness against attacker this paper propose new video steganography algorithm based multiple object tracking algorithm and hamming code proposed algorithm includes four different stage first secret message is preprocessed and hamming code n k applied order produce an encoded message second motion based multiple object tracking algorithm is applied cover video order identify region of interest of moving object third process of embedding 3 and 6 bit of encoded message into 1 lsb and 2 lsbs of rgb pixel component is performed motion region video using foreground mask fourth process of extracting secret message from 1 lsb and 2 lsbs each rgb component of moving region is accomplished experimental result of proposed video steganography algorithm demonstrated high embedding efficiency and high embedding payload
