classification of evolving data stream with infinitely delayed label data stream classification delayed label extreme verification latency online clustering majority of evolving data stream classification algorithm assume that actual label of predicted example readily available without any time delay just after prediction is made however given high label cost dependence of an expert limitation data transmission or even restriction imposed by problem s nature there is large number of real world application which availability of actual label is infinitely delayed never available these case it is necessary use of algorithm that doe not follow traditional process of monitoring error rate detect change data distribution and us most recent labeled data update classification model this paper propose method mclassification classify evolving data stream with infinitely delayed label our method is inspired use of micro cluster representation from online clustering algorithm considering presence of incremental drift our approach us distance based strategy maintain micro cluster position updated an evaluation several synthetic and real data show that mclassification achieves competitive accuracy result state of the art method and adequate computational cost main advantage of proposed method is absence of critical parameter that require user s prior knowledge occurs with rival method
