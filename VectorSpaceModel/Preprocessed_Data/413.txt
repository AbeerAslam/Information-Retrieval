automatic bitcoin address clustering bitcoin blockchain clustering privacy anonymity bitcoin is digital asset infrastructure powering first worldwide decentralized cryptocurrency of same name history of bitcoins owning and transferring address and transaction is available public ledger called blockchain but real world owner of address not known general that s why bitcoin is called pseudo anonymous however some address grouped by their ownership using behavior pattern and publicly available information from off chain source blockchain based common behavior pattern analysis common spending and one time change heuristic is widely used bitcoin clustering vote address association while offchain information tag is mostly used verify result this paper propose use off chain information vote address separation and consider it together with blockchain information during clustering model construction step both blockchain and off chain information not reliable and our approach aim filter out error input data result of study show feasibility of proposed approached bitcoin address clustering it useful user avoid insecure bitcoin usage pattern and investigator conduct more advanced de anonymizing analysis
