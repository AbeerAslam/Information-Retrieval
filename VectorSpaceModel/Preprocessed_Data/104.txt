graphical model based approach fault diagnosis of wind turbine lasso estimate wind turbine pitch system wind turbine operation and maintenance cost depend reliability of it component thus critical task is detect and isolate fault fast possible and restore optimal operating condition shortest time this paper machine learning of graphical model approach is proposed fault diagnosis of wind turbine particular pitch system role of latter is adjust blade pitch angle by rotating it according current wind speed order optimize wind turbine power production this is achieved by controller based blade pitch angle measured by two redundant sensor each blade without sensor accuracy reading controller misled and fail achieve optimal control strategy according current operation condition addition pitch angle sensor complete failure lead dangerous action of controller while fixed or drifted bias of sensor measurement may decrease controller s efficiency better control and overcome these challenge propose methodology that is based gaussian acyclic graphical model and lasso estimate methodology shown ability model and diagnose fault that occur pitch system wind turbine during it normal run and could lead fast recovery optimal operating condition
