speaker adaptation using speaker similarity score dnn feature deep neural network k nearest neighbor phoneme classification feature learning speaker adaptation this paper proposes novel speaker adaptation algorithm classifying speech based deep neural network dnns adaptation algorithm consists of two step first step deep neural network is trained using raw mel frequency cepstral coefficient mfcc feature discover hidden structure data and employing activation of last hidden layer of dnn acoustic feature second step using nearest neighbor an adaptation algorithm learns speaker similarity score based small amount of adaptation data from each target speaker using dnn based acoustic feature based speaker similarity score classification is done using k nearest neighbor k nn classifier novelty of this work is that instead of modifying and re training dnn speaker adaptation which comprises large number of parameter and is computationally expensive activation of learned dnn used project feature from mfcc sparse dnn space then speaker adaptation is performed based similarity i e nearest neighbor using k nn algorithm with only small amount of adaptation data it reduces number of phoneme classification error timit dataset by 23 this work also analyzes impact of deep neural network architecture speaker adaptation performance
