hybrid machine learning approach planning safe trajectory complex traffic scenario hybrid learning algorithm trajectory planning road traffic 3d convnets planning of safe trajectory with intervention both lateral and longitudinal dynamic of vehicle huge potential increasing road traffic safety main challenge development of such algorithm consideration of vehicle nonholonomic constraint and efficiency term of implementation so that algorithm run real time vehicle recently introduced augmented cl rrt algorithm is an approach that us analytical model trajectory planning based brute force evaluation of many longitudinal acceleration profile find collision free trajectory algorithm considers nonholonomic constraint of vehicle complex road traffic scenario with multiple static and dynamic object but it requires lot of computation time this work proposes hybrid machine learning approach predicting suitable acceleration profile critical traffic scenario so that only few acceleration profile used with augmented cl rrt find safe trajectory while reducing computation time this is realized using convolutional neural network variant introduced 3d convnet which learns spatiotemporal feature from sequence of predicted occupancy grid generated from prediction of other road traffic participant these learned feature together with hand designed feature of ego vehicle used predict acceleration profile simulation performed compare brute force approach with proposed approach term of efficiency and safety result show vast improvement term of efficiency without harming safety additionally an extension augmented cl rrt algorithm is introduced finding trajectory with low severity of injury if collision is already unavoidable
