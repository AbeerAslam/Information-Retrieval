parallel k medoids algorithm clustering based mapreduce k medoids canopy algorithm max min distance algorithm mapreduce k medoids algorithm is partition based algorithm which characteristic of simple implementation strong robustness and high accuracy however it some disadvantage such strong dependence selection of initial center unknown number of classification k high resource cost of frequent iteration of algorithm and poor clustering effect mass data order solve these problem original k medoids algorithm wa improved by introducing canopy algorithm and max min distance algorithm and k point were selected initial center of cluster era of big data use mapreduce computing framework parallelize algorithm experimental result show that improved clustering algorithm not only good speedup but also improves clustering accuracy and convergence and show large performance advantage dealing with large scale data
