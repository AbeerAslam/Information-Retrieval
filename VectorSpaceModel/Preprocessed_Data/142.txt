transfer learning of air combat behavior reinforcement learning transfer learning air combat training simulation computer generated force machine learning technique help automatically generate behavior computer generated force inhabiting air combat training simulation however complexity of scenario increase so doe time learn optimal behavior transfer learning potential significantly shorten learning time between domain that sufficiently similar this paper transfer air combat agent with experience fighting 2 versus 1 scenario various 2 versus 2 scenario performance of transferred agent is compared that of agent that learn from scratch 2v2 scenario experiment show that experience gained 2v1 scenario is very beneficial plain 2v2 scenario where further learning is minimal difficult 2v2 scenario transfer also occurs and further learning ensues result pave way fast generation of behavior rule air combat agent new complex scenario using existing behavior model
