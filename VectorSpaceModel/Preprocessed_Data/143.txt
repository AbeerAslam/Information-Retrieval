integrating active learning with supervision crowdsourcing generalization crowdsourcing active learning supervised classification with various online crowdsourcing platform it is easy collect multiple label same example from crowd consensus integration algorithm infer estimated ground truth from multiple label set of these crowdsourcing datasets however it could n t avoided that these integrated estimated label still contain noise order further improve performance of model learned from data with these integrated label propose an active learning framework further improve data quality such that improve model quality through acquiring limited true label from expert oracle further investigate two active learning strategy term of two uncertainty measure i e clue and mue within active learning framework from our experimental result eight simulation crowdsourcing datasets and four real world crowdsourcing datasets with three popular consensus integration algorithm draw several conclusion follows i our active learning framework with input from oracle significantly improves generalization ability of model learned from crowdsourcing data ii our two active learning strategy outperform random active learning strategy
