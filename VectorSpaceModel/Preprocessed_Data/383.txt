multiple kernel representation learning wifi based human activity recognition multiple kernel learning representation learning human activity recognition wifi csi data mining human activity recognition is becoming vital underpinning myriad of emerging application field of human computer interaction mobile computing and smart grid besides utilization of up to date sensing technique modern activity recognition system also require machine learning ml algorithm that leverage sensory data identification purpose view of unique characteristic of measurement data and ml challenge thereof propose non intrusive human activity recognition system that only us existing commodity wifi router core of our system is novel multiple kernel representation learning mkrl framework that automatically extract and combine informative pattern from channel state information csi measurement mkrl firstly learns kernel string representation from time frequency wavelet and shape domain with an efficient greedy algorithm then it performs information fusion from diverse perspective based multi view kernel learning moreover different stage of mkrl seamlessly integrated into multiple kernel learning framework build robust and comprehensive activity classifier extensive experiment conducted typical indoor environment and experimental result demonstrate that proposed system outperforms existing method and achieves 98 activity recognition accuracy
