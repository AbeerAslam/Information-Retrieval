clustering based grouping model enhanceing collaborative learning collaborative learning balanced k mean group diversity group work is widely used tertiary institution due considerable advantage of collaborative learning previous study indicated that group diversity positive influence group work achievement therefore how achieve diversity within group effectively and automatically is an interesting question this paper propose novel clustering based grouping model proposed technique first employ balanced k mean algorithm divide student into several size balanced cluster such that student within same cluster more similar some sense each other than those other cluster then adopts one sample each cluster strategy construct groups1 evaluated proposed technique based two small scale case study result observed may indicate that clustering based grouping model is feasible and effective
