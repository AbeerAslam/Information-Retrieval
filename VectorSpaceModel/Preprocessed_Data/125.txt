example specific density based matching kernel scene classification using support vector machine kernel support vector machine visualization histogram feature extraction semantics maximum likelihood estimation this paper propose example specific density based matching kernel esdmk classification of scene image represented set of local feature vector proposed kernel is computed between pair of example represented set of local feature vector by matching estimate of example specific density computed every local feature vector those two example this work number of local feature vector of an example among k nearest neighbor of local feature vector is considered an estimate of example specific density minimum of two example specific density one each example local feature vector is considered matching score esdmk is then computed sum of matching score computed every local feature vector pair of example also propose spatial esdmk sesdmk include spatial information present scene image while matching pair of scene image each of scene image is divided spatially into fixed number of region then sesdmk is computed combination of region specific esdmks that match corresponding region study performance of support vector machine svm based classifier using proposed esdmks scene classification and compare with that of svm based classifier using state of the art kernel set of local feature vector
