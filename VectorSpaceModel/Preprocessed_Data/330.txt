machine learning optimum ct prediction qpcr machine learning qpcr ct prediction algorithm sigmoid introduction of fluorescence based real time pcr rt pcr is increasingly used detect multiple pathogen simultaneously and rapidly by gene expression analysis of pcr amplification data pcr data is analyzed often by setting an arbitrary threshold that intersect signal curve it exponential phase if it exists point which curve cross threshold is called threshold cycle ct positive sample other when such cross of threshold doe not occur sample is identified negative this simple and arbitrary however not an elagant definition of ct value sometimes lead conclusion that either false positive or negative therefore purpose of this paper is present stable and consistent alternative approach that is based machine learning definition and determination of ct value
