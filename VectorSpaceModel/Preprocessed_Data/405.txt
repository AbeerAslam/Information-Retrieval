anomaly detection multivariate non stationary time series automatic dbms diagnosis anomaly detection non stationary time series automatic diagnosis reconstruction error statistical process control transfer learning anomaly detection database management system dbms is difficult because of increasing number of statistic stat and event metric big data system this paper i propose an automatic dbms diagnosis system that detects anomaly period with abnormal db stat metric and find causal event period reconstruction error from deep autoencoder and statistical process control approach applied detect time period with anomaly related event found using time series similarity measure between event and abnormal stat metric after training deep autoencoder with dbms metric data efficacy of anomaly detection is investigated from other dbms containing anomaly experiment result show effectiveness of proposed model especially batch temporal normalization layer proposed model is used publishing automatic dbms diagnosis report order determine dbms configuration and sql tuning
