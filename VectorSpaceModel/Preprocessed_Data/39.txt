expert bayes automatically refining manually built bayesian network medical informatics bayesian network structure learning bayesian network structure usually built using only data and starting from an empty network or from naive bayes structure very often some domain like medicine prior structure is already known based expert knowledge this structure automatically or manually refined search better performance model this work take bayesian network built by specialist and show that minor perturbation this original network yield better classifier with very small computational cost while maintaining most of interpretability of original network
