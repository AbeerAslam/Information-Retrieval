machine sourced segmentation v expert sourced segmentation classification of lung nodule with outlier removal machine sourced computer aided diagnosis crowd sourcing lung cancer segmentation computer aided diagnosis system provide additional opinion that serve an aid radiologist early detection of lung nodule previous cad model relied radiologist delineated contour extract image feature and classify lung nodule into semantic rating manually creating these contour time consuming and expensive this paper proposes different cad system based multiple machine sourced segmentation that provide semantic rating least accurate panel of expert order aid diagnostic process however mass production of machine sourced segmentation may sometimes produce unwanted noise therefore propose filter out bad segmentation by applying an outlier detection algorithm that identifies segmentation that far away from majority of segmentation our result compared cad system based expert sourced contour and reference truth generated by radiologist semantic rating using lung image database consortium dataset show that machine sourced segmentation provide prediction least good expert sourced segmentation and how outlier removal affect mostly shape dependent semantic rating
