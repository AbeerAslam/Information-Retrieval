improved selection of auxiliary objective using reinforcement learning non stationary environment non stationary objective selection multiobjectivization auxiliary objective ea rl reinforcement learning efficiency of evolutionary algorithm increased by using auxiliary objective method which is called ea rl is considered this method reinforcement learning rl algorithm is used select objective evolutionary algorithm ea during optimization earlier study reinforcement learning algorithm stationary environment were used ea rl method however if behavior of auxiliary objective change during optimization process it better use reinforcement learning algorithm which specially developed non stationary environment our previous work proposed new reinforcement learning algorithm used ea rl method this work propose an improved version of that algorithm new algorithm is applied non stationary problem and compared with method which were used other study it is shown that proposed method achieves optimal value more often and obtains higher value of target objective than other algorithm
