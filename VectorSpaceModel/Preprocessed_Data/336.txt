epilepsy cyberattack brain networked control system brain cyberattack efficiency epilepsy functional connectivity graph theory networked control system small world understanding pathway of neurological disorder requires extensive research both structural and functional characteristic of brain graph theoretical analysis of functional connectivity network highlight dynamic of communication among brain neuron resembling brain networked control system describes seizure epileptic episode response set of trigger this unknown set attempt destabilize system and so referred cyberattacks network terminology study investigates dynamic of brain network under attack of epileptic seizure focusing network parameter variation pre inter and post attack duration statistical analysis of scalp eeg based connectivity network found significantly p 0 05 higher global efficiency and lower clustering coefficient during attack compared those of before attack onset and system reinstatement study did not support existence of statistically significant difference small world index inter attack duration however network tends scatter from small word model
