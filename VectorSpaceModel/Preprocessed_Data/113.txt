study of use of complexity measure similarity search process adopted by knn algorithm time series prediction time series prediction similarity based method machine learning data mining last two decade with rise of data mining process there is an increasing interest adaptation of machine learning method support time series non parametric modeling and prediction non parametric temporal data modeling performed according local and global approach most of local prediction data strategy based k nearest neighbor knn learning method this paper propose modification of knn algorithm time series prediction our proposal differs from literature by incorporating three technique obtaining amplitude and offset invariance complexity invariance and treatment of trivial match evaluate proposed method with six complexity measure order verify impact of these measure projection of future value besides face our method with two machine learning regression algorithm experimental comparison were performed using 55 data set which available icmc usp time series prediction repository our result indicate that developed method is competitive and use of complexity invariant distance measure generally improves predictive performance
