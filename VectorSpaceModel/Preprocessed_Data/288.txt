event based weight update learning infinite spike train spiking neural network snn spike event spike train supervised learning multilayer network supervised learning method spiking neural network either able learn spike train single neuron or able learn first spike multilayer feedforward connection setting first group of learning method not use computational benefit of hidden layer neuron whereas second group of learning method not exploit information transfer potential of spike train although there been few effort learn spike train multilayer feedforward setting spiking neural network computational cost of these method increase when spike train is considered long period present spike event based weight update strategy that is able learn spike train pattern multilayer feedforward spiking neural network and is efficient and scalable learning spike train pattern indefinite period of time will compare this method with relevant spiking neural network learning algorithm based different benchmark datasets and show efficacy of this event based weight update learning
