brace treatment monitoring solution idiopathic scoliosis patient scoliosis brace treatment ubiquitous monitoring context aware activity detection scoliosis is medical condition which occurs adolescent where an individual s spine develops curvature thoracolumbosacral orthosis tlso is type of brace used control lateral curvature of spine scoliosis it is nonsurgical treatment with goal of preventing curve progression patient with idiopathic scoliosis successfully monitor compliance with brace treatment designed and developed wearable multi modal sensor solution is embedded into patient s brace custom designed hardware consists of sensor board force sensor an accelerometer and gyroscope force sensor collect force being exerted patient s back while accelerometer and gyroscope generate cue determine patient s activity and lifestyle this paper propose novel data mining method identify patient activity and evaluate effectiveness of brace treatment pervasively based fusion of continuous force and inertial motion recording our aim is design context aware remote monitoring system ubiquitous evaluation and enhancement of brace treatment compliance of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patient investigated experimental scenario which patient performs series of pre defined activity home during day long segment of brace wear during pervasive sensor data recording experimental result demonstrated that achieved an overall accuracy of 100 semi supervised activity detection level of tightness of brace fit reduced gradually over period of 4 week by 33
