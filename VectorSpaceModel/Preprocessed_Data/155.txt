effective user authentication using keystroke dynamic based feature selection keystroke dynamic keystroke feature security authentication biometrics efficient keystroke authentication system should ability capture and build user s pattern minimal time these system also should able achieve quickest detection while maintaining good detection accuracy however maintaining high detection accuracy and minimal detection delay conflicting requirement that need balanced possible approach tackle this problem is reducing number of feature that need learned by classifier and thereby decreasing processing time wrapper based feature subset selection approach is presented this paper with objective of reducing dimensionality of user data through identifying smaller subset of feature that represent most discriminating feature keystroke dynamic several feature selection technique such genetic and greedy algorithm best first search algorithm and particle swarm optimization pso used search best subset feature these selection technique integrated wrapped with different machine learning classifier namely support vector machine svm naive bayesian nb and k nearest neighbor knn feature subset selection procedure that automatically select most appropriate and representative subset of feature
