using domain knowledge feature wind turbine diagnostics feature selection domain knowledge scada data wind turbine fault detection svm fdd mrmr maximising electricity production from wind requires improvement of wind turbine reliability component failure result unscheduled or reactive maintenance turbine which incurs significant downtime and turn increase production cost ultimately limiting competitiveness of renewable energy thus critical task is early detection of fault this end present framework fault detection using machine learning that us supervisory control and data acquisition scada data from large 3mw turbine supplemented with feature derived from this data that encapsulate expert knowledge about wind turbine these new feature created using application domain knowledge that is general large horizontal axis wind turbine including knowledge of physical quantity measured by sensor approximate location of sensor time series behaviour of system and some statistic related interpretation of sensor measurement then use mrmr feature selection select most important of these feature new feature set is used train support vector machine detect fault classification performance using new feature set is compared performance using original feature set use of new feature set achieves an f1 score of 90 an improvement of 27 compared original feature set
