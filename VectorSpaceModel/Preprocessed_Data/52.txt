recommendation system market with two sided preference recommender system two sided market recent time witnessed emergence of large online market with two sided preference that responsible business worth billion of dollar recommendation system critical component of such market it is noted that matching such market depends preference of both side consequently construction of recommendation system such market call consideration of preference of both side online dating market and online freelancer market example of market with two sided preference past study building recommendation system such market however lack systematic approach observe that constructing recommendation system market with two sided preference posed an area under receiver operator curve auc optimization problem generalized linear regression model popular method of constructing ranking or recommendation system such market account of their ability learned easily from big data and their computational simplicity engineering platform conjecture that it is more likely matching such market complex combination of preference of both side account this introduce novel two level model optimizing auc of matching such market both synthetic and real data show that two level model algorithm better auc performance than direct application of generalized linear model such l_ 1 logistic regression or an ensemble method such random forest algorithm provide theoretical justification of auc optimality of two level model and pose theoretical problem more general result best of our knowledge this is first systematic study of recommendation system using auc optimization market with two sided preference
