bayesian nonparametric inverse reinforcement learning switched markov decision process markov decision process bayesian nonparametrics inverse reinforcement learning this paper develop bayesian nonparametric inverse reinforcement learning technique switched markov decision process mdp similar switched linear dynamical system switched mdp smdp used represent complex behavior composed of temporal transition between simpler behavior each represented by standard mdp use sticky hierarchical dirichlet process nonparametric prior smdp model space and describe markov chain monte carlo method efficiently learn posterior smdp model given behavior data demonstrate effectiveness of smdp model learning prediction and classification of complex agent behavior simulated surveillance scenario
