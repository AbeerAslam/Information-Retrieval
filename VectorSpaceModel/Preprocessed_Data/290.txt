probabilistic programming approach outlier detection healthcare claim fraud detection outlier detection healthcare fraud bayesian inference probabilistic programming healthcare is an integral component people s life especially rising elderly population medicare is one such healthcare program that provides need of elderly it is imperative that these healthcare program affordable but this is not always case out of many possible factor rising cost of healthcare claim fraud is major contributor but it impact lessened through effective fraud detection propose general outlier detection model based bayesian inference using probabilistic programming our model provides probability distribution rather than just point value with most common outlier detection method credible interval also generated further enhance confidence that detected outlier should fact considered outlier two case study presented demonstrating our model s effectiveness detecting outlier first case study us temperature data order provide clear comparison of several outlier detection technique second case study us medicare dataset showcase our proposed outlier detection model our result show that successful detection of outlier which indicate possible fraudulent activity provide effective and meaningful result further investigation within medical specialty or by using real world medical provider fraud investigation case
