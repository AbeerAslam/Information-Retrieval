differentiation and integration of machine learning feature vector kernel method classification gene coexpression network cancer this paper present new approach production of feature map improvement of classification machine learning idea is based calculus of differentiation and integration of feature vector which viewed function metric space or network based this propose novel network based binary machine learning classifier illustrate our method using molecular network alone distinguish phenotype including cancer type and subtypes include feature set derived from disease specific gene co expression network different cancer data set using cancer genome atlas tcga along with other previously published study also illustrate our network based predictor another data type based infrared spectroscopy of lung cancer tissue
