comparative study of different classification technique heart disease use case weka dynamic system classification machine learning technique heart disease common stream mining task include classification clustering and frequent pattern mining among them data stream classification drawn particular attention due it vast real time application through these application main goal is efficiently build classification model from data stream accurate prediction development of such model shown need machine learning technique applied large scale data range of machine learning technique exists and selection of accurate technique is based advantage and limit of each one and how these latter well address important research technique this paper present comparison of different classification technique using weka order investigate performance of collection of classification algorithm this comparison show support vector machine performance with higher accuracy and better result when classifying our dataset
