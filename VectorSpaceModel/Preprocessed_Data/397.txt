hdltex hierarchical deep learning text classification text mining document classification deep neural network hierarchical learning deep learning increasingly large document collection require improved information processing method searching retrieving and organizing text central these information processing method is document classification which become an important application supervised learning recently performance of traditional supervised classifier degraded number of document increased this is because along with growth number of document come an increase number of category this paper approach this problem differently from current document classification method that view problem multi class classification instead perform hierarchical classification using an approach call hierarchical deep learning text classification hdltex hdltex employ stack of deep learning architecture provide specialized understanding each level of document hierarchy
