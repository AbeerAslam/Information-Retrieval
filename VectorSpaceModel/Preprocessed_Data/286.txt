adaptive thresholding and reweighting improve domain transfer learning unbalanced data with application eeg imbalance transfer learning imbalance adaptive threshold domain adaptation method highly sensitive class balance particularly usually unknown balance of unlabeled test set this work analyze effect of imbalance well known algorithm artl adaptation regularization transfer learning and propose four approach mitigating adverse effect of imbalance these include 1 balancing training set pseudo label calculation 2 applying adaptive thresholding pseudo label calculation 3 using class reweighting optimization objective and 4 applying adaptive thresholding output objective tested these method with uci newsgroup dataset and three type of imbalanced eeg electroencephalogram classification problem observed significant improvement particularly case of extreme imbalance which not well addressed by standard classification technique
