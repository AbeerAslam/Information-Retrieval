efficient and rotation invariant fingerprint matching algorithm using adjustment factor minutia bifurcation ridge afis fingerprint minutia code this paper present new efficient and rotation invariant algorithm that make use of local feature forfingerprint matching minutia point first extracted from afingerprint image minutia code mc defined this paper is then generated each extracted minutia point proposed minutia code is invariant rotation of fingerprint image adjustment factor af is introduced address problem due difference claimant fingerprint and template fingerprint of same person that may present due variation inking or variation pressure applied between finger and scanner adjustment factor is calculated from minutia code mc of two fingerprint being matched two stage fingerprint matching process is proposed during first stage only few minutia code checked decide if second stage of matching process is required this make matching process faster proposed strategy is tested number of publicly available image db1 of fvc2004 database and result promising
