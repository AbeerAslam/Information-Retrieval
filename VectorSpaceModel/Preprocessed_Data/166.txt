using machine learning understand and mitigate model form uncertainty turbulence model machine learning turbulence modeling rule extraction question of how accurately model turbulent flow is one of most long standing open problem physic advance high performance computing enabled direct numerical simulation of increasingly complex flow nevertheless most flow of engineering relevance computational cost of these direct simulation is prohibitive necessitating empirical model closure turbulent transport these empirical model prone model form uncertainty when their underlying assumption violated understanding quantifying and mitigating this model form uncertainty become critical challenge turbulence modeling community this paper will discus strategy using machine learning understand root cause of model form error and develop model correction mitigate this error rule extraction technique used derive simple rule when critical model assumption is violated physical intuition gained from these simple rule is then used construct linear correction term turbulence model which show improvement over naive linear fit
