privacy preserving solution bipartite ranking problem bipartite ranking problem privacy preserving data mining this paper propose an efficient solution privacy preserving of bipartite ranking algorithm bipartite ranking problem considered finding function that rank positive instance dataset higher than negative one however one common concern existing scheme is privacy of individual dataset that is one e g researcher need access record of individual dataset order run algorithm this privacy concern put limitation use of sensitive personal data such analysis rimarc ranking instance by maximizing area under roc curve algorithm solves bipartite ranking problem by learning model rank instance part of model it learns weight each feature by analyzing area under receiver operating characteristic roc curve rimarc algorithm is shown more accurate and efficient than it counterpart thus use this algorithm building block and provide privacy preserving version of rimarc algorithm using homomorphic encryption and secure multi party computation our proposed algorithm let data owner outsource storage and processing of it encrypted dataset semi trusted cloud then researcher get result of his her query learn ranking function dataset by interacting with cloud during this process neither researcher nor cloud learns any information about raw dataset prove security of proposed algorithm and show it efficiency via experiment real data
