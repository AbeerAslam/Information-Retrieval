highly distributable computational framework fast cloud data retrieval distributed computing parallel processing associative memory cloud computing neural network hierachical graph neuron unlike existing relational hierarchical and object oriented scheme associative model analyze data similar way which our brain link information such interaction when implemented voluminous data cloud assist searching overarching relation complex and highly distributed data set with speed and accuracy this paper different perspective of data recognition will considered rather than looking conventional approach such statistical computation and deterministic learning scheme this paper will focusing distributed processing approach scalable data recognition and processing through applying an access scheme that will enable fast data retrieval across multiple record and data segment associatively utilizing parallel approach doing so will yield new form of databaselike functionality that scale or down over available infrastructure without interruption or degradation dynamically and automatically our proposed model data record treated pattern result data storage and retrieval is performed using distributed pattern recognition approach that is implemented through integration of loosely coupled computational network followed by divide and distribute approach that facilitates distribution of these network within cloud dynamically
