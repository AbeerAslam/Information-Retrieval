combining exact and metaheuristic technique learning extended finite state machine from test scenario and temporal property finite state machine constraint satisfaction problem ant colony optimization model checking control hybrid algorithm this paper address problem of learning extended finite state machine efsm from user specified behavior example test scenario and temporal property show how combine exact efsm inference algorithm that always find solution if it exists and metaheuristics derive an efficient combined efsm learning algorithm also present new exact efsm inference algorithm based constraint satisfaction problem csp solver experimental result reported showing that new combined algorithm significantly outperforms previously used metaheuristic
