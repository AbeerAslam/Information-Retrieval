constructing deep regression model utilizing cascaded sparse autoencoders and stochastic gradient descent traffic flow prediciton sparse autoencoders cascaded sparse autoencoders feature fusion deep regression model this paper discusses utilizing sparse autoencoders building regression model order predict real valued timeseries data focus of this research is exploiting and learning from determining feature of continuous data via stacked autoencoders thus increasing prediction accuracy of regression method archi tecture comprising different layer of sparse autoencod er where each level of autoencoders trained based standard typical method implemented and analyzed order enhance accuracy of typical model of training autoencoders cascaded model that benefit from fusion of low and high level feature is proposed objective is improve vehicular traffic flow forecasting since this area is research field pro gress that impact daily life sgd algorithm top level of deep architecture serf regression method evaluation based precision accuracy of algorithm applied forecasting traffic flow of location down key highway using historical traffic data of several location ahead twin city metro area of minneapolis
