towards sleep apnea screening with an under the mattress ir uwb radar using machine learning obstructive apnea hypopnea ultra wide band radar this work apply machine learning investigate effectiveness of an impulse radio ultra wide band ir uwb radar panel an under the mattress configuration detecting apnea event subject known obstructive sleep apnea osa consider collection of feature some novel and some inspired by feature that worked well sleep apnea detection using other type of sensor i e not ir uwb extract feature collected total of 25 hour of data from four subject they slept through night data included digitized sample of ir uwb radar return signal and scored polysomnograph psg which is gold standard and measure large number of physiological parameter well equipped sleep laboratory normal and apnea epoch were extracted from ir uwb data corresponding normal and apnea epoch psg data statistical feature were derived from these extracted epoch and linear discriminant classifier wa trained using cross validation found that classifier an accuracy of around 70 detection of apnea and normal epoch novel aspect of this project involves processing and investigation of different method feature extraction data obtained from real apnea subject and suggests that radar when paired with other under the mattress sensor might provide an effective screening device convenient form factor
