comparative evaluation of top n recommenders e commerce an industrial perspective recommender system e commerce implicit feedback collaborative filtering hyperparameter optimization recommender system survey experiment two real e commerce datasets and survey more than 30 popular e commerce platform reveal what method work best product recommendation industrial setting despite recent academic advance field observe that simple method such best seller list dominate deployed recommendation engine e commerce find our empirical finding well aligned with those of survey where both case simple personalized recommenders achieve higher ranking than more advanced technique also compare traditional random evaluation protocol our proposed chronological sampling method which used determining optimal time span of training history optimizing performance of algorithm this performance is also affected by proper hyperparameter tuning which propose golden section search fast alternative other optimization technique
