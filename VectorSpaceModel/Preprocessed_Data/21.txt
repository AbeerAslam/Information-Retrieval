human action recognition based recognition of linear pattern action bank feature using convolutional neural network human action recognition action bank feature deep convolutional network this paper proposed deep convolutional network architecture recognizing human action video using action bank feature action bank feature computed against of predefined set of video known an action bank contain linear pattern representing similarity of video against action bank video due independence of pattern across action bank feature convolutional neural network with linear mask is considered capture local pattern associated with each action knowledge gained through training is used assign an action label video during testing experiment conducted ucf50 dataset demonstrates effectiveness of proposed approach capturing and recognizing these linear local pattern
