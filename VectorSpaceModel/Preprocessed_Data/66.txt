using balanced random forest load spectrum data classifying component failure of hybridelectric vehicle fleet vegetation index battery tuning hybrid electric vehicle temperature measurement able optimize dimensioning of power train of hybrid electric vehicle engineer find relationship between stress of power train and failure of it component this paper apply machine learning technique random forest heterogeneous dataset consisting of so called load spectrum data resulting from transforming stress time function frequency distribution fatigue analysis this is state of the art data employed calculating fatigue life of component i study usability of random forest modeled this kind of data distinguish between faulty and non faulty vehicle and ii address problem of selecting small number of relevant variable order further decrease misclassification rate and even more important from our engineering point of view identify failure related variable our data contains just very few sample of faulty compared non faulty vehicle furthermore present framework tuning random forest handle this class imbalance demonstrate experimentally failure of hybrid car battery that using random forest variable selection and classification of load spectrum data achieves promising classification performance and enables engineer identify possible relationship between load and failure of hybrid component
