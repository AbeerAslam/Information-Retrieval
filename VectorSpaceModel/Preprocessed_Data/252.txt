demographic group prediction based smart device user recognition gesture demographic group prediction machine learning pca lda knn classification model propose novel demographic group prediction mechanism smart device user based upon recognition of user gesture core idea of our proposed approach is utilize data from variety of internal environmental sensor device predict useful demographic information order achieve this objective an application with several intuitive user interface wa implemented and used capture user data result presented here based upon data from fifty user these captured data integrated or fused pre processed analyzed and used training data supervised machine learning predictive approach data reduction method based upon principal component analysis pca and linear discriminant analysis lda pca lda were implemented reduce data feature dimension and improve k nearest neighbor knn supervised classification prediction result of our experiment indicate that high accuracy is achieved from this method best of our knowledge this is first research that us user recognition gesture predict multiple demographic group
