improving named entity recognition morphologically rich language using word embeddings czech ner named entity recognition word embeddings skip gram turkish ner this paper addressed named entity recognition ner problem morphologically rich language by employing semi supervised learning approach based neural network adopted fast unsupervised method learning continuous vector representation of word and used these representation along with language independent feature develop ner system evaluated our system highly inflectional turkish and czech language and obtained better f score performance than previously published result these language improved state of the art f score by 2 26 turkish and 1 53 czech unlike previous state of the art system developed these language our system doe not make use of any language dependent feature therefore believe it easily applied other morphologically rich language
