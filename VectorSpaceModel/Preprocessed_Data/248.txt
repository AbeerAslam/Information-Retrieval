correlating filter diversity with convolutional neural network accuracy convolutional neural network regularization normalization preprocessing this paper describes three metric used ass filter diversity learned by convolutional neural network during supervised classification our testbed use four different data set including two subset of imagenet and two planktonic data set collected by scientific instrument investigate correlation between our devised metric and accuracy using normalization and regularization alter filter diversity propose that these metric could used improve training cnns three potential application determining best preprocessing method non standard data set diagnosing training efficacy and predicting performance case where validation data is expensive or impossible collect
