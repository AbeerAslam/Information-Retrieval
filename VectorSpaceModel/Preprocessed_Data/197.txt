car following markov regime classification and calibration car following model regime classification model calibration driver behavior markov switching model car following behavior recently gained much attention due it wide variety of application this includes accident analysis driver assessment support system and road design this paper present model that leverage markov regime switching model classify various car following regime detected car following regime then mined calibrate parameter of driver dependent driver s current driving regime two stage markov regime switching model is utilized detect different car following regime first stage discriminates normal car following regime from abnormal one while second stage classifies normal car following regime their fine grained regime like braking accelerating standing free flowing and normal following genetic algorithm is then employed observed driver data each car following regime optimize car following model parameter value of driver each regime experimental evaluation of proposed model using real dataset show that it detect up normal rare and short time event addition it infer switching process dynamic such expected duration probability of moving from one regime another and switching parameter of each regime finally model is able accurately calibrate parameter of driver according their driving regime so achieve better understanding of driver behavior and better simulation of driving situation
