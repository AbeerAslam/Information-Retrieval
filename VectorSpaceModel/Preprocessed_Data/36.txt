varying coefficient model analyzing effect of risk factor pregnant woman s blood pressure varying coefficient model longitudinal data gestational hypertension study of gestational hypertension most of study focused whether risk factor is associated with gestational hypertension however according clinical experience it is important know effect of risk factor woman s blood pressure during pregnancy thus examined effect of known risk factor age hematocrit etc over gestational age also examined whether effect of known risk factor different between gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group these were studied 412 pregnant woman including 1874 clinical follow up record longitudinal clinical data of pregnant woman varying coefficient model were applied study effect of known risk factor over gestational age result showed that effect of known risk factor varied with gestational age and changing process of known risk factor over gestational age were different between gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group final used relative error criterion assess accuracy of estimated varying coefficient model relative error total clinical data gestational hypertension group and preeclampsia group were 13 3 8 1 and 14 3 respectively
