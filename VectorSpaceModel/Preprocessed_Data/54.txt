arctic sea ice extent forecasting using support vector regression arctic sea ice svr time series forecasting summer minimum arctic sea ice extent long been used measure of climate change with record low being reported recent year understanding dynamic of arctic sea ice extent is of utmost importance understanding timescales associated with this change complex global climate model typically employed gain insight about future of arctic sea ice however these model typically very computationally expensive solve and result often controversial here use historical data from remote sensing satellite along with machine learning algorithm forecasting of arctic sea ice extent support vector regression is employed learning of dynamic model represent this system validation result demonstrate ability of method successfully forecast both seasonal and long term trend arctic sea ice coverage
