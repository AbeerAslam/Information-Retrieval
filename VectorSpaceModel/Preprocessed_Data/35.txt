variational inference infinite mixture of inverse gaussian multinomial probit and exponential regression variational inference probit regression exponential regression inverse gaussian regression dirichlet process introduce new class of method and inference technique infinite mixture of inverse gaussian multinomial probit and exponential regression model that belong widely applicable framework of generalized linear model glm characterize joint distribution of response and covariates via stick breaking prior this lead various case nonparametric model an infinite mixture of inverse gaussian multinomial probit and exponential regression estimate of localized mean function which map covariates response presented prove weak consistency posterior distribution of exponential model sb ex and then propose mean field variational inference algorithm inverse gaussian multinomial probit and exponential regression finally demonstrate their superior accuracy comparison several other regression model such gaussian process regression dirichlet process regression etc
