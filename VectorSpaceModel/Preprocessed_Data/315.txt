web based pipeline tool combination of logic condition ng data next generation sequence ng pipeline genome analysis toolkit gatk development of software tool analyze next generation sequencing ng data is one of urgent task bioinformatics field currently lot of next generation sequencing data analysis software been developed however most of them only support one type of analysis such sequence alignment or function annotation by command line therefore friendly user interface of ng data with fewer configuration is necessary this paper web based automatic pipeline running high performance computing environment wa introduced raw data wa generated from illumine sequencing instrument gatk based parallel commutating scheme is used control and generate result pipeline start from fastq file uploaded by graphical interface then data will analyzed automatically
