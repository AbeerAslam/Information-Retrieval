machine learning approach false alarm detection critical arrhythmia alarm electrocardiography feature extraction monitoring database standard mimic heart rate high false alarm rate intensive care unit icu is common problem that lead alarm desensitization phenomenon called alarm fatigue alarm fatigue cause longer response time or missing of important alarm this work propose methodology identify false alarm generated by icu bedside monitor novelty our approach lie extraction of 216 relevant feature capture characteristic of alarm from both arterial blood pressure abp and electrocardiogram ecg signal our multivariate approach mitigates imprecision caused by existing heartbeat peak detection algorithm unlike existing method icu false alarm detection our approach doe not require separate technique different type of alarm experimental result show that our approach achieve high accuracy false alarm detection and generalized different type of alarm
