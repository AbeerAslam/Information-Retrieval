an interval radial algorithm hierarchical clustering analysis hierarchical clustering interval radial algorithm efficiency flexibility hierarchical clustering analysis hca produce structure that is more informative than an unstructured set of cluster however advantage come cost of lower efficiency analyzing large dataset with hca it is important improve it efficiency motivated by fact that small quantitative difference may not necessarily reflect change of qualitative property report an interval radial algorithm hca by grouping data point within neighborhood interval radial algorithm is o n 2 both agglomerative and divisive approach under an easy satisfy weak condition algorithm adaptively adjust radius during it execution furthermore algorithm provides flexibility user them select initial radius and step size such that produce customized output automatically report algorithm it analysis and result of computational experiment several benchmark datasets example and illustrative dendrograms included
