understading image restoration convolutional neural network with network inversion deep learning neural network underwater dehazing visualization image restoration recent year convolutional neural network cnns achieved state of the art performance many image restoration application knowledge of how these model work however is still limited while there been many attempt better understanding inner working of cnns they mostly been applied classification network because of this most existing cnn visualization technique may inadequate study of image restoration architecture paper present network inversion new method developed specifically help understanding of image restoration convolutional neural network apply our method underwater image restoration and dehazing cnns showing how it help understanding and improvement of these model
