interaction network representation human behavior prediction human behavior prediction network representation learning deep learning health social network human behavior prediction is critical studying how healthy behavior spread through social network this work present novel user representation based human behavior prediction model user representation based socialized gaussian process model ursgp first present deep interaction representation learning deep interaction model learning latent representation of interaction social network which each user is characterized by set of attribute particular consider social interaction factor and user attribute factor build bimodal fixed representation of each user network our model aim capture evolution of social interaction and user attribute and learn hidden correlation between them then use our latent feature human behavior prediction via ursgp model an empirical experiment conducted real health social network demonstrates that our model outperforms baseline approach human behavior prediction
