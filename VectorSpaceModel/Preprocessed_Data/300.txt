extending soft set towards optimality of decision based multiple decision over same data decision making fuzzy logic soft set fuzzy operation soft set integrated with fuzzy logic this paper and this research work further extends cagman s work soft set it make parametric value associated with every individual object of extended soft set fuzzy form this increase decision capability of soft set approach distinguish one object from another based their fuzzy parameter value further prove several fuzzy soft operation based new concept furthermore provide concept of and row operation which describes product of soft set with fuzzy parameter value then sum operation and row product construct decision making approach this increase capability multiple decision maker same data reach final selection based their individual conclusion
