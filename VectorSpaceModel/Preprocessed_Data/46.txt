modelling mutual information between voiceprint and optimal number of mel frequency cepstral coefficient voice discrimination feature selection voiceprint mfccs information theory this paper study relationship between voiceprint and optimal number of mel frequency cepstral coefficient mfccs which yield highest classification accuracy of voice discrimination voiceprint is modelled sub mfccs matrix with first d number of mfccs model relationship through information theory and formulate it mutual information maximization problem subject probability constraint solution of this optimization problem provides optimal number of mfccs which yield highest classification accuracy of voice discrimination together with confidence level this study is dictated by need understand use of mfccs which proliferated since it invention discriminate voice evaluate our model by comparing leave one out cross validation loocv result of usual multi class classifier supervised learning gaussian mixture model slgmm with set of spoken word and solo acapella singing experimental result show that our model is more comprehensive feature selection criterion mfccs than de facto technique loocv
