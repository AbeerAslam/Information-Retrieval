augmenting interactive evolution with multi objective optimization interactive evolutionary computation multi objective evolutionary algorithm novelty search serendipitous discovery deceptive fitness landscape growing concern field of evolutionary computation recent work demonstrated that incorporating human insight with short term automated evolution synergistic effect that eas deception and accelerates discovery of solution while human evaluator provide rich insight into domain they fatigue easily previous work reduced number of human evaluation by evolving diverse set of candidate via intermittent search novelty while successful evolving solution deceptive maze domain it lacked ability measure solution quality that human evaluator implicitly identified important key insight of this paper that multi objective evolutionary algorithm moeas foster diversity and that non dominated set serve surrogate novelty while measuring user preference data this new approach called pareto optimality assisted interactive evolutionary computation poa iec leverage human intuition by allowing user identify candidate non dominated set that they feel promising interestingly experimental result demonstrate that poa iec find solution significantly fewer evaluation than previous approach and that non dominated set contains significantly more novel behavior than dominated set this way poa iec simultaneously leverage human insight while quantifying their preference
