automatic generation and recommendation api mashups ap imashups nlp machine learning deep learning until today finding most suitable apis use an application wa burdensome requiring manual and time consuming search across diverse set of website particular regarding how multiple apis could combined and worked together i e api mashups this paper propose new method automatically generate api mashups through real world data collection text mining and natural language processing nlp technique generated api mashups further ranked and recommended developer based quantitative indicator of whether given api mashup is plausible evaluate overall accuracy of proposed method use generated api mashups train several machine learning and deep learning model and then use an independent mashup dataset collected from github project testing experimental result show that our proposed method is feasible and accurate automatic api mashup generation and recommendation
