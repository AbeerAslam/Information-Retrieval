cybersecurity automated information extraction technique drawback of current method and enhanced extractor cybersecurity information extraction machine learning entity extraction address crucial element of applied information extraction accurate identification of basic security entity text by evaluating previous method and presenting new labelers our survey reveals that previous effort not been tested document similar targeted source news article blog tweet etc and that sufficiently large publicly available annotated corpus of these document exists by assembling representative test corpus perform quantitative evaluation of previous method realistic setting revealing an overall lack of recall and giving insight model beneficial and inhibiting element particular our result show that many previous effort overfit non representative test corpus this domain informed by this evaluation present three novel cyber entity extractor which seek leverage available labeled data but remain worthwhile more diverse document encountered wild each new model increase state of art recall with maximal or near maximal f1 score our result establish that state of art cyber entity tagging is characterized by f1 0 61
