topic novelty detection using infinite variational inverted dirichlet mixture model inverted dirichlet dirichlet process nonparametric bayesian variational bayes mixture model topic novelty detection propose model based inference topic novelty detection using non parametric bayesian probability model probability model is dirichlet process mixture of inverted dirichlet distribution which viewed an infinite mixture model inference is based variational bayes deployed using approximate conjugate prior inverted dirichlet detailed experimental study demonstrates merit of our approach and show that it give good description of data
