facial expression recognition using kinect depth sensor and convolutional neural network convolutional neural network cnn facial expression recognition facial expression recognition is an active area of research with application design of human computer interaction hci system this paper propose an approach facial expression recognition using deep convolutional neural network cnn based feature generated from depth information only gradient direction information of depth data is used represent facial information due it invariance distance from sensor ability of convolutional neural network cnn learn local discriminative pattern from data is used recognize facial expression from representation of unregistered facial image experiment conducted eurecom kinect face dataset demonstrate effectiveness of proposed approach
