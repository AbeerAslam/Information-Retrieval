hierarchical meta classifier human activity recognition accelerometer legged locomotion feature extraction monitoring data mining activity recognition decision tree this paper proposes multi level meta classifier identifying human activity based accelerometer data training data consists of 77 subject performing combination of 23 different activity and monitored using single hip worn triaxial accelerometer time and frequency based feature were extracted from two second window of raw accelerometer data and subset of feature together with demographic information wa selected classification activity were divided into five activity group non ambulatory activity walking running climbing upstairs and climbing downstairs multiple classification technique were tested each classifier level and group random forest were found perform comparatively better each level based upon those test 3 level hierarchical classifier consisting of 5 random forest classifier wa built first level non ambulatory activity separated from rest second ambulatory activity divided into four activity group final level activity classified individually accuracy test set wa found approximately 87 overall individual activity and 94 activity group level these result compare favorably contemporary result classifying human activity
