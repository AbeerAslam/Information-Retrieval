deep learning of cell classification using microscope image of intracellular microtubule network deep learning image classification cell image microtubule cytoskeleton radiality microtubule network mt component of cell that may indicate presence of various chemical compound and used recognize property such treatment resistance therefore classification of mt image is of great relevance cell diagnostics human expert find it particularly difficult recognize level of chemical compound exposure of cell improving accuracy with automated technique would significant impact cell therapy this paper present application of deep learning mt image classification and evaluate it large mt image dataset of animal cell with three degree of exposure chemical agent result demonstrate that learned deep network performs par or better corresponding cell classification task than human expert specifically show that task of recognizing different level of chemical agent exposure handled significantly better by neural network than by human expert
