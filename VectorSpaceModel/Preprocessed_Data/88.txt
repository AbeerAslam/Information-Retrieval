transient characteristic of dc dc converter with pid parameter selection and neural network control neural network dc dc converter pid control this paper present neural network based pid parameter selection control improve transient response of dc dc converter conventional pid control parameter of it such proportional integral and differential coefficient selected fixed parameter regulate both transient and steady state characteristic simultaneously much possible parameter setting of pid control is not optimal improvement of transient state characteristic since setting need satisfy stable steady state characteristic therefore parameter selection different state is widely applicable from point of view of improvement of transient response this study present novel parameter selection method pid control based load change prediction of neural network improve transient response of dc dc converter presented method suitable pid parameter selected with neural network this neural network is trained predict load change from output voltage of dc dc converter advance from predicted result of neural network pid parameter changed optimal one after load change occurs additionally reference modification with another neural network which is trained modify reference value of pid control is also adopted simultaneously obtain more effective improvement of transient response from evaluation result confirm that our presented method contributes obtain an effective improvement of transient response compared conventional pid control
