wifi localization mobile robot based random forest and gplvm wifi slam mobile robot random forest gplvm khepera proliferation of wifi network attracted many research community employ wifi signal estimating location of mobile device indoor environment in this paper propose localization framework that is capable of determining location of mobile robot indoor limited area proposed framework exploit random forest algorithm both classification and regression technique which used build cooperated supervised localization model localization model trained offline based training data that contains measurement of wifi signal strength and location of these measurement also proposed an extension our framework using gaussian process latent variable model gplvm which give our framework ability build subjective localization model which n t require any prior knowledge about ground truth of localization place our experimental evaluation of proposed framework using kheperaiii mobile robot one testbed show that it give high accuracy where calculated mean localization error is 36 cm
