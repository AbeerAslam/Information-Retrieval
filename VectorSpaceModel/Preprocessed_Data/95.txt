dynamic inclusion of new event type visual inspection using evolving classifier expected change classifier s accuracy visual inspection new event type integration of new class on the fly evolving fuzzy classifier this paper dealing with automatic inclusion of new event type visual inspection system within context of image classification recognizing ok and not ok part certain event directly associated with class event usually independent and disjoint from each other this sense dealing with problem of integrating new class into image classifier on the fly once specified on line by an operator using evolving fuzzy classifier efc which relying fuzzy rule base and able adapt their structure and update their parameter incremental manner novel methodological aspect lie 1 appropriate structural change efc whenever new class appears and 2 estimation of expected change classifier accuracy older class seen before which is based an analysis of expected change classifier s decision boundary second point is an important aspect operator they already familiar work with established classifier that some accuracy classification new concept will evaluated real world visual inspection scenario where main task is classify event type which may occur micro fluidic chip and may lead deterioration of their quality
