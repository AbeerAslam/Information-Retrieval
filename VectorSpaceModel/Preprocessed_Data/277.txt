phase identification electric power distribution system by clustering of smart meter data data mining k mean clustering phase identification principal component analysis smart meter accurate network and phase connectivity model crucial distribution system analytics operation and planning although network connectivity information is mostly reliable phase connectivity data is typically missing or erroneous this paper an innovative phase identification algorithm is developed by clustering of voltage time series gathered from smart meter feature based clustering approach is adopted where principal component analysis is first carried out extract feature vector from raw time series constrained k mean clustering algorithm is then executed separate customer smart meter into various phase connectivity group algorithm is applied real distribution feeder southern california edison s service territory accuracy of proposed algorithm is over 90
