concept drift awareness twitter stream twitter adaptation model time frequency analysis event detection context vector learning non stationary environment is not an easy task and requires distinctive approach learning model must not only ability continuously learn but also ability change already acquired concept additionally given significant importance that social network gained information network there is an ever growing interest extraction of complex information used trend detection promoting service or market sensing this dynamic nature tends limit performance of traditional static learning model and dynamic learning strategy must put forward this paper present learning strategy learn presence of concept drift twitter propose three different model time window model an ensemble based model and an incremental model since little is known about type of drift that occur twitter simulate different type of drift by artificially timestamping real twitter message order evaluate and validate our strategy result so far encouraging regarding learning presence of drift along with classifying message twitter stream
