prediction of spei using mlr and ann case study wilson promontory station victoria multi linear regression model artifial neural network model standardized precipitation index drought modelling prediction of drought is of major importance climate related study hydrologic engineering wildlife or agricultural study this study explores ability of two machine learning method predict 1 3 6 and 12 month standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index spei wilson promontory station eastern australia two method multiple linear regression mlr and artificial neural network ann data driven model were based combination of input variable mean precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperature and evapotranspiration data between 1915 and 2012 two performance metric were used compare performance of optimum mlr and ann model coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse it wa found that ann provided greater accuracy than mlr forecasting 1 3 6 and 12 month spei
