superposed naive bayes accurate and interpretable prediction naive bayes classifier bagging boosting ensemble method model transformatiomn performance interpretability background data mining and machine learning technique been widely applied software engineering research however past research mainly focused only prediction accuracy aim interpretability of prediction result should accorded greater emphasis software engineering research prediction model that high accuracy and explanatory power is required method propose new algorithm of nave bayes ensemble called superposed nave bayes snb which firstly build an ensemble model with high prediction accuracy and then transforms it into an interpretable nave bayes model result conducted an experiment with nasa mdp datasets which performance and interpretability of proposed method were compared with those of other classification technique result of experiment indicate that proposed method produce balanced output that satisfy both performance and interpretability criterion conclusion confirmed effectiveness of proposed method an experiment using software defect data model extensively applied other application area where both performance and interpretability required
