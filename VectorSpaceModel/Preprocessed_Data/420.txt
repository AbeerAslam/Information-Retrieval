prediction of power grid failure using neural network learning power grid analysis neural network saidi forecast binary classification machine learning application smart city power grid failure potential drastically affect population it localized outage or large scale blackout pre event planning currently consists of preparation scenario and some enthusiastic prognosis leading most resource spreading thin focus specific area of concern typically follows large scale power grid failure post event analysis and doe not include an overall analysis this study neural network is used conduct pre event analysis of power grid determine if it is susceptible failure this research study demonstrates that overall pre event analysis beneficial with use of machine learning agent agent also used determine area that need most attention future work with larger number of constraint and additional machine learning algorithm will explored further improve power grid analysis and performance
