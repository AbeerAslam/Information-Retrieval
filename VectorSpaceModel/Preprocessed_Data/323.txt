efficient content replacement wireless content delivery network with cooperative caching content caching machine learning q learning markov decision process wireless content delivery network wcdns received attention promising solution reduce network congestion caused by rapidly growing demand mobile content amount of reduced congestion is intuitively proportional hit ratio wcdn cooperation among cache server is strongly required maximize hit ratio wcdn where each cache server is equipped with small size cache storage space this paper address content replacement problem that deal with how manage content limited cache storage space reactive manner cope with dynamic content demand over time new challenge apply reinforcement learning which is q learning content replacement problem wcdn with coooperative caching model content replacement problem markov decision process mdp and finally propose an efficient content replacement strategy maximize hit ratio based multi agent q learning scheme simulation result exhibit that proposed strategy contributes achieving better content delivery performance delay due higher hit ratio compared typical existing scheme of least recently used lru and least frequently used lfu
