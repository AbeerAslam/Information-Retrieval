hybrid method intrusion detection intrusion detection k nearest neighbor genetic algorithm network attack intrusion detection system idss used detect malicious action information system such computing and networking system abnormal behavior or activity network system could detected by security system but conventional security system such anti virus and firewall not successful many malicious action overcome this problem better and more intelligent id solution required this study hybrid approach wa proposed use detect network attack genetic algorithm ga and k nearest neighbor knn method were combined model and detect attack knn wa employed classify attack and ga wa used select k neighbor of an attack sample this hybrid system wa first applied intrusion detection field system provides advantage such decreasing dependency of full training data set and providing plausible solution intrusion detection result showed that proposed system provides better result than single system
