dynamic factor mixture of expert functional time series modeling functional time series dynamic factor analysis mixture of expert visualization state space model variational em new approach is introduced this paper dynamic modeling and dimensionality reduction from time series of curve this purpose dynamic mixture of expert model whose regression coefficient evolve from curve curve according gaussian random walk over low dimensional factor is proposed resulting model is neither else than particular state space model involving discrete and continuous latent variable whose parameter learned across sequence of curve through dedicated variational expectation maximization algorithm experimental study conducted simulated sequence of curve shown strong potential of proposed approach
