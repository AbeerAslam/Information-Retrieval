novel algorithm dynamic clustering property and performance dynamic clustering data mining on line learning multi density clustering this paper present dynamic clustering algorithm that efficiently deal with data stream and achieves several important property which not generally found together same algorithm dynamic clustering algorithm operates online two different time scale stage fast distance based stage that generates micro cluster and density based stage that group micro cluster according their density and generates final cluster algorithm achieves novelty detection and concept drift thanks forgetting function that allows micro cluster and final cluster appear drift merge split or disappear this algorithm been designed able detect complex pattern even multi density distribution and making assumption of cluster convexity performance of dynamic clustering algorithm is assessed theoretically through complexity analysis and empirically through set of experiment
