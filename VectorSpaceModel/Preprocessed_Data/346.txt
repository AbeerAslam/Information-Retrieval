deeppositioning intelligent fusion of pervasive magnetic field and wifi fingerprinting smartphone indoor localization via deep learning indoor localization fingerprinting wifi magnetic field deep learning smartphone since wifi been pervasively available indoor most smartphone indoor localization system based wifi fingerprinting although they only give coarse grained location estimation this paper propose novel deep learning based indoor fingerprinting system called deeppositioning combining received signal strength indicator rssi of wifi and pervasive magnetic field obtain richer fingerprinting deeppositioning includes an offline learning phase and an online serving phase offline learning phase deep learning is utilized automatically extract rich intrinsic feature from large number of multi class fingerprint collected using mobile phone experimental result demonstrate that deep learning model with intelligent fusion of pervasive wifi and magnetic field data effectively improve smartphone indoor localization compared existing approach based wifi only
