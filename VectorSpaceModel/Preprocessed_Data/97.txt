semi supervised clustering approach semantic slot labelling natural language processing semantic slot labelling semi supervised learning interactive system work training semantic slot labellers use natural language processing application typically either relied large amount of labelled input data or assumed entirely unlabelled input former technique tends costly apply while latter is often not accurate it supervised counterpart here present semi supervised learning approach that automatically label semantic slot set of training data and aim strike balance between dependence labelled data and prediction accuracy essence of our algorithm is cluster clause based similarity function that combine lexical and semantic information present experiment that compare different similarity function both our semi supervised setting and fully unsupervised baseline while semi supervised learning expectedly outperforms unsupervised learning our result show that this effect observed based very few training data instance and that increasing size of training data doe not lead better performance and that lexical and semantic information contribute differently different domain so that clustering based both type of information offer best generalisation
