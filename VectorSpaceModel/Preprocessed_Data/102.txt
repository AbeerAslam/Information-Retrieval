assessment of different image clutter metric using multivariate analysis and neurofuzzy system target detection computer vision statistical image clutter metric multivariate analysis neurofuzzy system image processing is most frequently used technique computer vision like target detection of monitored target image recognize background clutter and observed target image evaluate performance of various image processing algorithm image clutter metric very important and useful factor better visual conception such increasing probability of detection decreasing false alarm rate or relatively shorter searching time this paper different image clutter metric such probability of detection false alarm rate and search time assessed by statistical analysis technique and neurofuzzy system through applying other statistical image clutter metric order improve machine visual conception with resolving machine cognitive constraint computer vision
