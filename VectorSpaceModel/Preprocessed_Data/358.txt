learning robust video synchronization without annotation deep learning synchronization video understanding large scale self supervised aligning video sequence is fundamental yet still unsolved component broad range of application computer graphic and vision most classical image processing method not directly applied related video problem due high amount of underlying data and their limit small change appearance present scalable and robust method computing non linear temporal video alignment approach autonomously manages it training data learning meaningful representation an iterative procedure each time increasing it own knowledge it leverage nature of video themselves remove need manually created label while previous alignment method similarly consider weather condition season and illumination our approach is able align video from data recorded month apart
