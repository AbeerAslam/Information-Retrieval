multi period prediction of solar radiation using arma and arima model solar radiation multi period prediction arma arima due variation weather condition solar power integration electricity grid high penetration rate cause threat grid stability therefore it is required predict solar radiation parameter order ensure quality and security of grid this study initially 1 h time series model belong solar radiation parameter is created multi period prediction afterwards autoregressive moving average arma and autoregressive integrated moving average arima model compared term of goodness of fit value produced by log likelihood function result of determining best statistical model multi period prediction one period two period and three period ahead prediction carried out solar radiation parameter comprehensive way many feasible comparison been made solar radiation prediction
