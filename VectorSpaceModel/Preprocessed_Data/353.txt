attribute assisted interpretation confidence classification using machine learning self organizing map interpretation uncertainty support vector machine learning an attribute assisted classification deriving estimate of interpretation confidence wa performed instantaneous and coherency attribute were used supervised followed by an unsupervised classification resulting an error envelope of interpretation an initial approximation confidence weight signal and background response estimated using support vector machine learning subsequently weighted discrimination based several coherency attribute using self organizing map is obtained resulting quantization is used additional input and constraint final probability assessment of signal confidence using instantaneous attribute support vector machine learning additional input form of quantization vector and possible reduction dimensionality of input attribute vector space allows combine highly non linear correlation multivariate discrimination trained classification is used assign signal confidence probability an interpreted seismic horizon proposed methodology is applied an onshore data set from wyoming usa revealing how single and multi trace attribute used quantitatively assess uncertainty of an interpretation often lost during project maturation
