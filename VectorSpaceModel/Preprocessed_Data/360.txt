machine learning appearance based robot self localization machine learning mobile robot self localization appearance based learning deep learning manifold learning an appearance based robot self localization problem is considered machine learning framework appearance space is composed of possible image which captured by robot s visual system under robot localization using recent manifold learning and deep learning technique propose new geometrically motivated solution based training data consisting of finite set of image captured known location of robot solution includes estimation of robot localization mapping from appearance space robot localization space well estimation of inverse mapping modeling visual image feature latter allows solving robot localization problem kalman filtering problem
