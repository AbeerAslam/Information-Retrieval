an intelligent technique detecting malicious user mobile store mobile store security resource exhausting artificial neural network ann do attack this study malicious user who cause resource exhausting tried detect telecommunication company network non legitimate user could cause lack of information availability and need countermeasure prevent threat or limit permission system this purpose ann based intelligent system is proposed and compared svm which is well known classification technique according result proposed technique achieved approximately 70 general success rate 33 false positive rate and 27 false negative rate controlled environment also ann high ability work compare svm our dataset result proposed technique and developed application show sufficient and acceptable defense mechanism huge company network discussed about this is initial study and ongoing research which is compared current literature by way this study also show that non security information such user mobile experience could potential usage prevent resource exhausting also known do related attack
