improved time series classification with representation diversity and svm time series classification machine learning time series representation time series classification time series classification is an important task data mining that been traditionally addressed with use of similarity based classifier 1 nn dtw is typically considered most accurate model temporal data nevertheless some author recently proposed ingenious alternative 1 nn dtw by using diversity of time series representation or by using dtw feature extraction this paper explore diversity of time series representation and distance function obtain distance feature which turn used train an svm model argue that scientific community largely neglected vast body of unconventional distance function and present empirical evidence that distance feature better than 1 nn dtw with respect classification accuracy
