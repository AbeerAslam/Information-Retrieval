filer response time prediction using adaptively learned forecasting model based counter time series data storage system counter time series forecasting ability predict future performance of storage system is critical it efficient management modern storage system is very complex combination of hardware and software element and inferring it state from those of it individual component is practically impossible moreover state of system undergoes continuous change due diverse and evolving workload frequent configuration change and natural degradation component this paper present an approach predict future response time of storage system by applying combination of machine learning technique data of it internal parameter best of our knowledge this is first attempt quantify response time of storage system directly from time series of it internal parameter present systematic experimental setup collecting system data and measuring it response time while loading system with different standard workload another novel contribution of paper is combination of time series forecasting model followed by regression model predict response time repeatedly real time said model is shown able repeatedly predict fairly accurate 15 minute ahead response time value using system data of past 20 minute window it is shown that validation calculation typically complete within 30 second an average using computer of moderate configuration making presented model applicable practically reasonable prediction horizon design of model is such that it adaptively tuned online regular interval more system data is observed
