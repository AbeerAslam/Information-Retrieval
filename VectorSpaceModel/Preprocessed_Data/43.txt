using k nearest neighbor and speaker ranking phoneme prediction speech recognition phoneme k nearest neighbor classification phoneme prediction template matching speech recognition system either based parametric approach or non parametric approach parametric based system such hmms been dominant technology speech recognition past decade despite lot of advancement and enhancement design of these system key problem such long term temporal dependence etc not yet been solved recently due availability of large amount of data and inexpensive computing resource processing power and memory parametric based approach solve speech recognition and classification task is becoming popular and feasible key advantage of parametric based approach is that information from training data is retained dont approximate our data with specific statistical model resulting more speaker specific information this paper propose knn phoneme prediction scheme using speaker ranking vector speaker ranking vector is generated by finding similarity of given test speaker with training data using knn result were compared with nearest neighbor and knn majority voting approach our proposed scheme give better prediction accuracy compare with nearest neighbor and knn majority voting scheme this approach help speech recognizer customize fly given talker and customize training data basis of similarity measure
