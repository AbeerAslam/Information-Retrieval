multi label classification of anemia patient multi label classification class imbalance biomedical informatics anaemia this work examines application of machine learning an important area of medicine which aim diagnose paediatric patient with thalassemia minor iron deficiency anemia or co occurrence of these ailment iron deficiency anemia is major cause of microcytic anemia and is considered an important task global health whilst existing method based linear equation proficient distinguishing between two class of anemia they fail identify co occurrence of this issue machine learning algorithm however induce non linear decision boundary that enable accurate classification within complex domain through multi label classification technique known problem transformation convert learning task one that is appropriate machine learning and examine effectiveness of machine learning algorithm this domain our result show that machine learning classifier produce good overall accuracy and able identify instance of co occurrence class unlike existing method
