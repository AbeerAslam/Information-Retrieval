feature selection using gustafson kessel fuzzy algorithm high dimension data clustering feature selection informative weight fuzzy clustering cluster validation performance of objective function based fuzzy clustering algorithm depends shape and volume of cluster initialization of clustering algorithm distribution of data object and number of cluster data feature selection is also one of most important issue high dimension data clustering specifically bioinformatics data mining signal processing etc where feature space dimension tends very large making both clustering and classification task very difficult it is evident that feature subset needed successfully perform given clustering and recognition task depends discriminatory quality of chosen feature propose new hybrid approach addressing feature selection based informative weight which take into account membership degree of feature performed by gustafson kessel fuzzy algorithm purpose is efficiently achieve high degree of dimensionality reduction and enhance or maintain predictive accuracy with selected feature candidate feature subset generated by using iterative feature elimination procedure which result estimation of feature informative weight use both supervised and unsupervised method order evaluate clustering ability of feature subset
