better case adaptation method case based effort estimation using multi objective optimization multi objective particle swarm optimization case based reasoning adaptation method software effort estimation case based reasoning cbr is considered one of efficient method area of software effort estimation because of it outstanding performance and capability of handling noisy datasets this study examines performance of multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm find best configuration parameter adaptation process particularly propose new adaptation method which it parameter optimized by making trade off between multiple accuracy measure proposed adaptation is fully automated and able dynamically adapt each case dataset individually based empirical validation over 8 datasets performance figure seen good improvement against conventional cbr and some adapted version of cbr
