hedonic housing theory machine learning investigation linear regression pcr svm knn hedonic pricing model housing price prediction comparative market analysis kaiser meyer olkin bartlett test henze zirkler s multivariate normality test hedonic pricing theory suggests that house is differ entiated commodity whose value depends it hetero geneous characteristic application of theory been well implemented using ols regression our study investigates this econometric concept using machine learning algorithm an improved pricing will benefit buyer seller investor bank and real estate professional normality test experiment wa done using chi square quantile quantile plot and henze zirkler s multivariate normality test statistical relationship wa based correlation matrix kaiser meyer olkin and bartlett test support vector regression svr k nearest neighbor k nn and principal component re gression pcr were used learning algorithm per formance comparison of learning algorithm wa done using spearman s rho correlation coefficient performance of model showed that pcr slight edge over svr and k nn also study validated suitability and substitutability of pcr svr and k nn implementation of hedonic pricing theory
