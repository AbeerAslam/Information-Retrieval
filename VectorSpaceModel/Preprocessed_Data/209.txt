learning complex event from sequence with informed gap complex event programming frequent sequence pattern mining constraint programming complex event processing is key technology current business which sequence of event controlled however defining complex event is not easy and sequence learning algorithm help that end sequence learning method should consider temporal relationship among event this paper tackle problem of mining complex event using frequent sequence pattern mining with time gap constraint model of learning problem is proposed consistently learning problem is addressed using solver off shelf experiment carried out bike hiring domain so cep system account how many user will reach depot independently of which wa their origin result analysed term of individual and multiple user well regarding scalability of method
