oups combined approach using smote and propensity score matchingtching accuracy sensitivity data model machine learning algorithm training equation building accurate classifier is difficult when using data that is skewed or imbalanced which is typical of real world data set two popular approach that been applied improving classification accuracy and statistical comparison of imbalanced data set synthetic minority over sampling technique smote and propensity score matching psm novel sampling approach is introduced referred over sampling using propensity score oups that blend two and is simple and easy perform resulting improvement accuracy and sensitivity over both smote and psm performance of our proposed approach is assessed using simulation experiment and several performance metric shown where this approach fare and fall comparison others
